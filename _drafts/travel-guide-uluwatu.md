Uluwatu is a south-eastern part of the Bukit Peninsula and is considered to be a more laid-back area of Bali. It is famous for its beautiful beaches, world-class waves, and breathtaking clifftop views. You absolutely cannot miss it when visiting the island. We recommend you stay there for at least 3-4 days. This way you won’t have to rush and will be able to fully relax and feel the local atmosphere.

Good to know is that Uluwatu doesn’t have a boardwalk or a “downtown”. Everything is spread out and you will need a scooter or a transfer to get around.&nbsp;

## Where to eat in Uluwatu

## Best beaches in Uluwatu

The main thing to know about beaches in Uluwatu is that not every beach is suitable for swimming. Uluwatu is a surfing mecca, so big waves are to be expected. However, there are still a lot of beautiful white-sand beaches in Uluwatu, you just have to know where to find them.

* Dreamland - this one is without a doubt our favorite. Even though it is also very popular amongst tourists, it is still absolutely worth a visit. A long stretch of white sand, turquoise water, and a breathtaking view of the Indian Ocean. There is a possibility to rent sunbeds and umbrellas, and there are a few local warungs to grab a meal.
* Bingin Beach - great for advanced surfers (in high tide) as well as enjoying a scenic view while sipping on a fresh coconut in a local warung. If you come here during low tide, water is much calmer and suitable for swimming.
* Impossible Beach - it is considered to be one of the most demanding Bali surf points and is popular amongst pro-surfers. This beach is quite difficult to reach, hence the name. Being located beneath the white stone cliff it has a charming panorama of the Indian Ocean, and this by itself should be a reason to visit it.&nbsp;
* Melasti Beach - this beach has probably the calmest water in Uluwatu. Its located below a high cliff, so you will need to climb some stairs to get there.&nbsp;
* Thomas Beach - if we had to choose two words to describe this beach, they would be beautiful and underrated. You can enjoy uncrowded waves or rent an umbrella and have a relaxing day at the beach.&nbsp;
* Green Bowl Beach - the picture-perfect white-sand beach. However, prepare to climb hundreds of stairs to get there, but trust us it will be worth it.
* Nyang Nyang Beach - there is a half-buried shipwreck, that makes the beach quite popular. The best time to visit is either before 12 pm or for sunset. It takes about 20 minutes (so as to the most of the other beaches in Uluwatu) to trek down the cliff to get to the beach.&nbsp;

Good to keep in mind that getting to most of the beached on the east coast of Uluwatu includes a lot of steep stairs.&nbsp;

## Where to stay in Uluwatu

* [<u>Gravity Hotel</u>](https://gravitybalihotel.com/) - it’s a boutique hotel with private bungalows and suites. The resort is located 5-7 minutes drive from Padang Padang, Uluwatu, and Green Bowl beaches.&nbsp;
* [<u>Sal Secret Spot</u>](https://www.instagram.com/sal_secret_spot/) - this guest house is more budget-friendly but still provides great services. Located close to Bingin Beach.&nbsp;
* [<u>Dreamsea surf</u>](https://dreamseasurfcamp.com/bali/) - if the reason you are coming to Uluwatu is to learn surfing you should consider staying in Dreamsea Surf Camp. This is also a great place for solo travelers to meet new friends.&nbsp;

## Where to relax in Uluwatu

* [<u>The Istana</u>](https://theistana.com/facilities/spa) - after a day of surfing and climbing all those stairs, only imagine how great it would feel to have a relaxing massage in one of the best Spa’s in Bali. They have everything from a Meditation Hall to Cryotherapy.&nbsp;

## Day hangouts Uluwatu

* [<u>Sunday&rsquo;s Beach Club</u>](https://www.sundaysbeachclub.com/) - temporarily closed due to COVID-19. In the meantime, they are working on building more areas and will open as soon as group gathering will be safe again. Definitely keep this place on your list for your next visit.&nbsp;
* [<u>Ulu the Cliff</u>](https://ulucliffhouse.com/) - a great option for a chill day. You can find everything in one location - accommodation, food & drinks, swimming pool with day beds, party, ocean deck to watch the sunset.&nbsp;
* Bingin Beach - how does ‘fresh fish & Bali sunset’ sound like? The place you want to go to is called Lucky Fish. You can pick your own fresh fish straight from the fishermen and it will be cooked for you on the BBQ. Food is served with steamed rice, spinach, and some homemade Indonesian salsa. Tables are placed right on the beach facing yet another beautiful Balinese sunset.
* [<u>El Kabron</u>](https://elkabron.com/hedonism-lounge) - unfortunately, due to CODID-19 is temporarily closed as well, but trust us, you want to visit this place once it’s back open. Inspired by Spanish cuisine and design it has an infinity pool overlooking the Indian Ocean.&nbsp;
* [<u>Single Fin</u>](https://www.singlefinbali.com/) - enjoy an iced-coffee or a Bintang on the terrace that is overlooking the infamous Uluwatu surf break. If you are looking for a fun night-out you want to be there either on a Wednesday or a Sunday. That’s when the biggest parties with international Dj’s are happening.&nbsp;
* [<u>Karma Beach Club</u>](https://karmagroup.com/karma-beach/) - a relaxing beachfront cafe during the day followed by a buzzing fun-filled bar at night.
