intro-paragraph-emphasis: 5 Examples of Responsible Tourism
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>Sustainable and responsible tourism has always been the number one priority
  for Marie and I whenever we visit a country and culture that isn&rsquo;t our
  own. Not only that, now more than ever we have seen first hand how devastating
  the lack of tourism can be for economies and livelihoods in countries such as
  Indonesia. With all that in mind it has forced us to ask ourselves the
  question &ldquo;How can we be responsible tourists during this Coronavirus
  pandemic?&rdquo;</p><p>Having been living in Bali for X - (Jake to fill in)
  months, which is the longest we have been in one place for X - (Jake to fill
  in) years, we really had the itch to continue travelling not only to
  experience and document new places, but also to check in with friends and
  family back home too. With Europe calling we faced this new challenge of
  making sure we could travel without jeopardizing the safety of
  others.</p><p>As we prepare to make our way from Bali - (inlink?) to Germany -
  (inlink?) via Greece - (inlink?) and Italy - (inlink?) we will talk you
  through the 5 most important examples of how you too can be a responsible
  tourist. From practicing social distancing to respecting the laws, rules and
  regulations of the countries you travel to and from, continue reading to hear
  all about our first hand experiences.</p>

      <h2>1 - Get Tested Before Leaving</h2><p>One of the biggest differences we
      noticed about travelling during the Coronavirus was the extra preparation
      that goes in beforehand.</p><p>After making a last minute decision to
      leave our Bali island life to head back to Europe, one of the essentials
      was to get ourselves tested for the virus.</p><p>This is one of the most
      important and essential responsible tourism examples we can give
      you.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking this test not only gives you the peace of mind to
      know that you can travel without the risk of infecting others, it also
      gives you the relevant paperwork to show airlines and border controls that
      you are no risk to travel and enter.</p><p>Taking the test itself
      isn&rsquo;t a pleasant experience, which some of you guys might have seen
      when watching our Instagram stories - (link to @mariefeandjakesnow), but
      there was no way we could have got on that flight without receiving those
      negative results.</p>

      <h2>2 - Practice Social Distancing</h2><p>After spending so much time in
      isolation and mostly with just each other, and of course Leo, it was
      really strange to be back at the airport and around people again.</p><p>We
      love meeting and being around people so social distancing has taken the
      most getting used to for Marie and I.</p><p>It&rsquo;s recommended that at
      this point, you should be keeping around 2 meters (3 steps) away from
      other people.&nbsp;</p><p>We found the airport to be so eerily quiet that
      this wasn&rsquo;t too difficult. Not only that every restaurant, store or
      desk for example had markings on the floor to remind you to keep your
      distance.</p><p>Responsible travelling means abiding by the rules and
      being respectful of others so keeping the 2 meter distance is important
      for respecting those things.</p>
