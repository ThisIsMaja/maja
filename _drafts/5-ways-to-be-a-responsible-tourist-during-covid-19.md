intro-paragraph-emphasis: 5 Examples of Responsible Tourism
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>Sustainable and responsible tourism has always been the number one priority
  for Marie and I whenever we visit a country and culture that isn&rsquo;t our
  own. Not only that, now more than ever we have seen first hand how devastating
  the lack of tourism can be for economies and livelihoods in countries such as
  Indonesia. With all that in mind it has forced us to ask ourselves the
  question &ldquo;How can we be responsible tourists during this Coronavirus
  pandemic?&rdquo;</p><p>Having been living in Bali for X - (Jake to fill in)
  months, which is the longest we have been in one place for X - (Jake to fill
  in) years, we really had the itch to continue travelling not only to
  experience and document new places, but also to check in with friends and
  family back home too. With Europe calling we faced this new challenge of
  making sure we could travel without jeopardizing the safety of
  others.</p><p>As we prepare to make our way from Bali - (inlink?) to Germany -
  (inlink?) via Greece - (inlink?) and Italy - (inlink?) we will talk you
  through the 5 most important examples of how you too can be a responsible
  tourist. From practicing social distancing to respecting the laws, rules and
  regulations of the countries you travel to and from, continue reading to hear
  all about our first hand experiences.</p>

      <h2>1 - Get Tested Before Leaving</h2><p>One of the biggest differences we
      noticed about travelling during the Coronavirus was the extra preparation
      that goes in beforehand.</p><p>After making a last minute decision to
      leave our Bali island life to head back to Europe, one of the essentials
      was to get ourselves tested for the virus.</p><p>This is one of the most
      important and essential responsible tourism examples we can give
      you.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking this test not only gives you the peace of mind to
      know that you can travel without the risk of infecting others, it also
      gives you the relevant paperwork to show airlines and border controls that
      you are no risk to travel and enter.</p><p>Taking the test itself
      isn&rsquo;t a pleasant experience, which some of you guys might have seen
      when watching our Instagram stories - (link to @mariefeandjakesnow), but
      there was no way we could have got on that flight without receiving those
      negative results.</p>

      <h2>2 - Practice Social Distancing</h2><p>After spending so much time in
      isolation and mostly with just each other, and of course Leo, it was
      really strange to be back at the airport and around people again.</p><p>We
      love meeting and being around people so social distancing has taken the
      most getting used to for Marie and I.</p><p>It&rsquo;s recommended that at
      this point, you should be keeping around 2 meters (3 steps) away from
      other people.&nbsp;</p><p>We found the airport to be so eerily quiet that
      this wasn&rsquo;t too difficult. Not only that every restaurant, store or
      desk for example had markings on the floor to remind you to keep your
      distance.</p><p>Responsible travelling means abiding by the rules and
      being respectful of others so keeping the 2 meter distance is important
      for respecting those things.</p>

      <h2>3 - Maintain Good Cleanliness &amp; Hygiene</h2><p>If ever there was a
      time to maintain a high standard of cleanliness and hygiene it&rsquo;s
      now!</p><p>We have absolutely no doubt that you guys take good care of
      yourselves, so forgive us if this advice appears condescending, but Marie
      and I noticed there were improvements we could make to protect ourselves
      and others with this.</p><p>Just some little tips we would recommend after
      doing some research and having experience travelling from Asia to Europe
      would be:</p><ul><li>Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20
      seconds whenever you can. If you catch a look at a bathroom sign then jump
      in and give them hands a wash.</li><li>Carry around a little travel sized
      bottle of hand sanitizer just in case you don&rsquo;t have access to a
      bathroom for some time. Always good to apply this after you've touched
      anything too.</li><li>Wearing a mask is of course essential, but if you
      are going to cough or sneeze then make sure you have some tissues to hand.
      Gone are the days you can do this into your hands or sleeve!</li><li>Avoid
      touching your eyes, nose or mouth if you can, especially if your hands
      aren&rsquo;t clean.</li></ul>

      <h2>4 - Abide by Rules &amp; Regulations</h2><p>Tourism rules and
      regulations have never been stricter than they are now so it&rsquo;s vital
      that you do your research before and during a visit to any new travel
      destination.</p><p>You will find that rules and regulations vary from
      country to country and are also changeable day by day due to how volatile
      the coronavirus can be.</p><p>What might have been OK today might not be
      tomorrow, so to avoid upsetting the authorities it&rsquo;s important that
      you continually check with the relevant sources of the countries that you
      are in or plan to travel too.</p>

      <h2>5 - Show Respect to Others</h2><p>The biggest advice we can give to
      all of you responsible travellers out there would be to show love,
      compassion and respect to everyone around you.</p><p>Being in our Bali
      bubble, where everything appears to be pretty normal, it was easy to
      forget how hard it has been on others around the world.</p><p>We have to
      respect those living in the countries that we plan to visit and understand
      the hardships that the Coronavirus has affected everyone mentally,
      physically and financially.</p><p>This means spreading more love and
      positivity than ever. It means showing compassion for those who have
      potentially lost jobs or even worse their loved ones. It means showing
      respect to those around us even if they appear short with us because we
      have no idea what they have been through.</p><p>From fellow travellers to
      the locals we have to look after and help each other now more than
      ever.</p>

      <h2>Be a Responsible Tourist</h2><p>There is no doubting this is a super
      sensitive time to be travelling and we understand first hand the fears
      that some of you may have.</p><p>However, we feel like travel is the key
      to connection that we must fight to maintain whilst of course showing
      respect to this virus and the dangers that it has.</p><p>Travel is what
      brought Marie and I together. Documenting our journey is what brought us
      and you together through this shared love and passion for going to new
      places and seeing new things. What feeds our soul more than anything else
      is continuing to explore this incredible planet to educate ourselves on
      what&rsquo;s important and what is not.</p><p>Together we have to ensure
      that the ability to travel must survive. We want to see borders open and
      countries and economies to thrive once again and we can all play our part
      by being mindful and responsible travellers.</p>
