  <h1>The most in-demand job nowadays</h1><p>A few weeks ago we have published a
  blog post about the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://thisismaja.com/posts/remote-jobs-to-make-money-online">best
  remote jobs to make money online</a>. The very first job we mentioned was a
  Web developer. The reason for that is that we truly believe this is one of the
  most in-demand digital jobs nowadays.</p><p>Saying that we do realize that a
  lot of you might feel scared and intimidated by this job title, at least
  that&rsquo;s how we felt. You might be thinking web development requires
  advanced mathematical knowledge and high-level tech skills. And while it is
  true at the higher skill levels, it is definitely not an absolute must and we
  learned this fact when we attended <a href="__notset__">The </a><a
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://www.instituteofcode.com/">Institute of Code</a> web development
  boot camp. No matter your background, you CAN learn web
  development.&nbsp;</p><p>For those of you who are not very familiar with the
  term &ldquo;web development&rdquo;, we will explain it briefly.</p>

      <h2>What is web development?</h2><p>To put it in simple words web
      development is building a website for the internet. It includes coding and
      programming. Web developers receive a web design, usually created by web
      designers, and turn it into a website by writing lines of code. Some of
      the programming languages you might have heard of are HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, Python, etc.</p>

      <h2>What is the Institute of Code?</h2><p><em>About a year ago</em> we
      decided that we wanted to rebrand and redesign our website, so we started
      searching for the best ways to do it. It was important to us that our
      website could be completely customizable and it was equally important that
      we understood how it all worked. We also wanted a unique website that
      didn't look like a lot of other template websites that you can easily
      build on squarespace or WIX for example. After doing a lot of research and
      a lot of contemplation about how our website would be built. We decided to
      find a course that would teach us the ins and outs of web
      development.&nbsp;</p><p>We pretty quickly stumbled upon the Institute of
      Code and their 10 day all inclusive web development bootcamp hosted in
      Bali, through a recommendation from a good friend.&nbsp;</p><p>We
      contacted the team and after chatting to Tina and Emile - co-founders of
      the Institute of Code, we knew that their 10-day Web Development Bootcamp
      was exactly what we needed.</p>

      <h2>What is included in a Web Development Bootcamp?</h2><p>The program
      starts with a 6-weeks online study, which you can do at your own pace.
      Followed by the best part - 10 days bootcamp in Bali.&nbsp;</p><p>During
      those 10 days, you get together with a bunch of like-minded people from
      all over the world to focus on all things web development but especially -
      learning to code.</p><p>The Institute of Code is not a typical school.
      They have reinvented the study process most of us are used to, by digging
      deep into educational psychology, motivation, and high performance. The
      learning environment they have cultivated in their bootcamp is one that
      motivates you but also lets you enjoy, it promotes learning and also
      promotes connection.</p><p>Tina and Emile believe that by eliminating
      distractions of everyday life, such as cooking, cleaning, commuting, etc.,
      they create an environment that helps get people into a state of mind that
      fosters accelerated learning. That&rsquo;s why during the bootcamp you
      will have free access to daily yoga &amp; meditation classes, and
      nutritious meals prepared by an in-house chef.</p><p>On top of that the
      bootcamp is hosted in Bali which is inspiring and relaxing in the most
      special kind of way.&nbsp;</p><p>All the extra comforts are there in order
      to free your time and mind, so can give your 100% to studying. You will be
      working with expert mentors that will be able to give you one-on-one
      support.</p><p>The Institute of Code also offers a similar program but for
      Social Media and Content Creation. On top of that, they also have a Free
      SEO Masterclass, where you&rsquo;ll learn how to rank high on Google and
      drive free traffic to your website. A few students from our course loved
      it so much they actually decided to jump right into the social media
      course immediately after the web dev course we were on.</p>

      <h2>Why we recommend The Institute of Code?</h2><p>Web development seems
      really daunting to most people. The Institute of Code breaks this stigma
      and makes this incredibly valuable skill set fun to learn and makes you
      feel like you&rsquo;re on a holiday at the same time. We met some amazing
      people and came out of the course with the tools and the inspiration to
      continue building our dream website. You are on that site right now
