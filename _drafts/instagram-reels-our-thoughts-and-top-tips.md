      <h2>What are Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram launched its new feature,
      Reels, on 5th August 2020. Instagram Reels allow you to create multi-clip
      videos and use audio, different effects and various tools to make them
      creative and appealing.</p><p>Reels can be shared with your followers via
      uploading them to your feed and if your account is public you can also
      share them to the explore page, which has a dedicated new space to
      showcase popular Reels. Reels are another fun way to create on the
      Instagram platform.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see <a target="_blank"

      <h2>How Instagram&rsquo;s new Reels feature works</h2><ol><li>From your
      homepage in the Instagram app, open the camera and you&rsquo;ll see
      options for Live, Story and Reels.&nbsp;</li><li>When you select Reels you
      will be able to see the editing options on the left-hand side of your
      screen. These include: video length, audio, speed, effects, timer and
      countdown.</li><li>First, you can choose how long you want your Reel to
      be. There are currently two options: 15 seconds or 30
      seconds.&nbsp;</li><li>Next, record your video in clips one at a time or
      upload previously recorded videos from your camera roll. You can use the
      timer and countdown tool to help you record clips handsfree. If you want
      to add filters or effects you can select these using the AR effects tool
      before you record your clips.&nbsp;</li><li>Once you&rsquo;ve recorded or
      uploaded a clip you can add GIFs, stickers, pens and text using the usual
      Instagram tools that you&rsquo;ll be familiar with from
      Stories.</li><li>Add some audio. You can search for a song on
      Instagram&rsquo;s music library using the audio tool or upload original
      audio via the clips from your camera roll. When you use original audio it
      will be attributed to you if you have a public account. To use someone
      else&rsquo;s original audio you can select &ldquo;use audio&rdquo; from
      their Reel. You might want to add your audio before you record clips
      depending on what sort of video you&rsquo;re creating!</li><li>Once you
      have all your clips recorded and uploaded, you can check through
      everything to make sure it&rsquo;s how you want it and share when
      you&rsquo;re happy!</li><li>On the share screen you can save your Reel as
      a draft, add a cover image, add a caption, add hashtags and tag other
      accounts. Once you&rsquo;ve added everything you want on this screen
      there&rsquo;s an option to publish your Reel. If you have a public account
      you can publish to the explore page and to your feed however if
      you&rsquo;ve got a private page you can only publish Reels to your
      feed.&nbsp;</li><li>Reels are saved in a special Reels tab on your profile
      page - this is where you can find all the Reels you&rsquo;ve created,
      regardless of where you&rsquo;ve shared them. You can see other peoples
      Reels by going to their profile and clicking on their Reels tab. If an
      account hasn&rsquo;t created and published any Reels they won&rsquo;t have
      a Reels tab!&nbsp;</li><li>If you want you can share your Reels to your
      Stories.</li></ol>
