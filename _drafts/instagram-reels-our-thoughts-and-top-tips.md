      <h2>What are Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram launched its new feature,
      Reels, on 5th August 2020. Instagram Reels allow you to create multi-clip
      videos and use audio, different effects and various tools to make them
      creative and appealing.</p><p>Reels can be shared with your followers via
      uploading them to your feed and if your account is public you can also
      share them to the explore page, which has a dedicated new space to
      showcase popular Reels. Reels are another fun way to create on the
      Instagram platform.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see <a target="_blank"

      <h2>How Instagram&rsquo;s new Reels feature works</h2><ol><li>From your
      homepage in the Instagram app, open the camera and you&rsquo;ll see
      options for Live, Story and Reels.&nbsp;</li><li>When you select Reels you
      will be able to see the editing options on the left-hand side of your
      screen. These include: video length, audio, speed, effects, timer and
      countdown.</li><li>First, you can choose how long you want your Reel to
      be. There are currently two options: 15 seconds or 30
      seconds.&nbsp;</li><li>Next, record your video in clips one at a time or
      upload previously recorded videos from your camera roll. You can use the
      timer and countdown tool to help you record clips handsfree. If you want
      to add filters or effects you can select these using the AR effects tool
      before you record your clips.&nbsp;</li><li>Once you&rsquo;ve recorded or
      uploaded a clip you can add GIFs, stickers, pens and text using the usual
      Instagram tools that you&rsquo;ll be familiar with from
      Stories.</li><li>Add some audio. You can search for a song on
      Instagram&rsquo;s music library using the audio tool or upload original
      audio via the clips from your camera roll. When you use original audio it
      will be attributed to you if you have a public account. To use someone
      else&rsquo;s original audio you can select &ldquo;use audio&rdquo; from
      their Reel. You might want to add your audio before you record clips
      depending on what sort of video you&rsquo;re creating!</li><li>Once you
      have all your clips recorded and uploaded, you can check through
      everything to make sure it&rsquo;s how you want it and share when
      you&rsquo;re happy!</li><li>On the share screen you can save your Reel as
      a draft, add a cover image, add a caption, add hashtags and tag other
      accounts. Once you&rsquo;ve added everything you want on this screen
      there&rsquo;s an option to publish your Reel. If you have a public account
      you can publish to the explore page and to your feed however if
      you&rsquo;ve got a private page you can only publish Reels to your
      feed.&nbsp;</li><li>Reels are saved in a special Reels tab on your profile
      page - this is where you can find all the Reels you&rsquo;ve created,
      regardless of where you&rsquo;ve shared them. You can see other peoples
      Reels by going to their profile and clicking on their Reels tab. If an
      account hasn&rsquo;t created and published any Reels they won&rsquo;t have
      a Reels tab!&nbsp;</li><li>If you want you can share your Reels to your
      Stories.</li></ol>

      <h2>Instagram Reels versus TikTok</h2><p>If you haven&rsquo;t used Reels
      yet or you don&rsquo;t have it yet (it&rsquo;s only available in 50+
      countries so far!) you might be thinking it sounds a lot like Tik
      Tok.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been widely reported that the development of Reels
      by Instagram was a response to the Tik Tok app which has grown massively
      in 2020. It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to see that Instagram has borrowed
      heavily from the essense of Tik Tok, and at first glance they look very
      similar. However it&rsquo;s when you look at them for what they are you
      can see that they are ever so slightly different.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, Tik
      Tok is it&rsquo;s own social media app dedicated to this type of informal,
      short-medium-form video. Instagram Reels on the other hand is just one of
      many Instagram features that all sit inside the same app providing one big
      creative expeirence.</p><p>The second difference we've noticed are the
      tools that are available when creating videos for Tik Tok and Reels. Tik
      Tok is slightly easier to use in some parts as it has the ability to
      automatically syn your audio for example, whereas Instagram Reels is
      slightly more manual in terms of matching up music in comparison. Tik Tok
      also has options like duet which Reels currently don&rsquo;t
      have.</p><p>Finally, while Tik Tok is offically banned in some countries
      such as India, Instagram is not yet available in all countries, for
      example Indonesia, so which app you might use and favour might come down
      to which one lets you best reach your audience or which one is available
      to you!</p><p>Many creators such as ourselves, who are lucky enough to be
      in a country with access to both, have chosen to remain on Tik Tok while
      also creating content for Reels. This way we can all keep a presence on
      both apps, utilising the features of both and see where this takes us! If
      you&rsquo;ve got the access and the time and energy then there&rsquo;s no
      reason why you can&rsquo;t do both.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are in a country
      that doesn&rsquo;t have access to Reels yet, you might be able to access
      Reels by connecting to a VPN service, choosing a country that you know has
      Instagram Reels, deleting the Instagram app from your phone, then
      re-downloading the Instagram app. You can check out our blog post to find
      out about the <a

      VPNs</a>.</p>

      <h2>Reels versus Stories versus IGTV</h2><p>You might be confused with
      having so many different options for video formats on Instagram. Stories,
      IGTV, Reels - it can be a lot! So what are the differences and which video
      format should you use for what?</p><p>We&rsquo;ve generally found that
      IGTV is great for information and longer-form videos and video series -
      think of it a bit like YouTube.</p><p>Stories are very social focused and
      obviously great for capturing the short-form, more informal, day-to-day
      stuff.</p><p>You can think of Reels as filling that gap between IGTV and
      Stories. Reels are more entertainment driven and give the ability to
      create short-form content that is high-quality, that can be formal or
      informal but that has a longer shelf-life than 24 hours!&nbsp;</p><p>Reels
      give a lot of tools to control audio, speed, AR effects and more.
      It&rsquo;s more like a mini-editing suite that&rsquo;s not actually a
      video editor, where you can even achieve smoother transitions between
      clips by aligning them. Reels are more shareable than Stories since you
      can share Reels on your feed, on the explore page and even via Stories.
      You can get creative with the audio on Reels and upload your own original
      video that includes audio -&nbsp;the audio is attributed to you and others
      can also use it in their Reels.</p><p>To be honest, we&rsquo;ve really
      been enjoying creating on Instagram with Reels! We&rsquo;ve found it is
      the easiest way to grow organically on Instagram in 2020. If you
      haven&rsquo;t played around with Reels yet and you want to take advantage
      of the organic growth opportunities then we highly recommend you give
      Reels a go!</p>
