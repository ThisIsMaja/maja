  <p>From the moment I made that decision I have been fighting a constant battle
  to rebalance my hormones and regain the healthy skin I once had. It has been a
  tiring process and I almost gave in several times to the allure of clean skin
  by manipulating my hormones with the &lsquo;pill&rsquo;. In this blog post I'm
  not going to talk about why the pill is bad for you or why I decided to quit.
  At this point I just want to share with you how I succeeded at rebalancing my
  hormones and how I brought my skin back under control. Keep reading to find
  out how : )</p><p>This is for all you girls out there who want to get off the
  pill but you have struggled with skin issues every time you try. I want you to
  believe there is a way for you to regain your healthy skin and say goodbye to
  the horrible pill for good. I can tell you now with patience and commitment
  you can do it. And I am confident that with the right information and learning
  from my mistakes you can do it much quicker.&nbsp;</p><p>It for sure
  hasn&rsquo;t been easy and I've tried almost every treatment you can think of.
  From different diets, medications and home remedies to staying out of the sun
  or covering my face in apple cider vinegar. I tried it all and I finally found
  a remedy for me. Now I know what I need to do to control my skin, but that
  doesn't mean my skin is always perfect. It just means that I know why my skin
  goes bad when it does, and I know how to fix it.</p><p>If you struggle with
  any sort of skin issue you really need to ask yourself WHY!! What does my skin
  want to tell me here? The skin is our biggest organ and holds 20% of our
  natural bacteria in it and on it, this bacteria gets fed by the other 80% of
  our bacteria in our gut. The skin is the window to our inner health and is
  also an organ that releases a lot of our toxins. So if there is something
  wrong with your skin, ask yourself - what could be the tigger??</p><p>Do I
  have too much physical or mental stress right now, how good is my sleep, am I
  drinking enough, do I drink alcohol or smoke, what do I eat?? These are the
  questions we need to ask ourselves. I know life sometimes isn't fair and there
  are girls out there who have great skin while eating whatever they want. But
  that does not mean they are healthy. They might even be still taking the birth
  control pill which helps with your skin but causes a lot of harm to your
  body.</p>

      <h3>How I healed my skin after coming off the pill</h3><p>The first thing
      I would suggest if you&rsquo;re wanting to come off the pill or if
      you&rsquo;re already trying, is to go and get a complete blood test. The
      results will let you know if you are deficient in any nutrients or if you
      have other conditions that need to be taken care of that might affect or
      be affecting your skin.</p><p>After a couple months of being off the pill
      I also recommend you get a hormone test to gauge how your hormones are
      balancing out.</p><p>Now if you&rsquo;re anything like me I know
      you&rsquo;re serious about taking back control of your hormones and just
      overall becoming more in tune with your true self. So I'm going to jump
      right into the most effective solution that I found to heal my skin and
      rebalance my internal system. It is not an easy solution and it takes
      willpower to stick to it but it will change everything if you
      can.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3 id="the-veganpescatarian-candida-diet"><strong>The vegan/pescatarian
      candida diet&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>I got on this diet to try and heal my
      all my fungus diseases (my <strong><a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nutriplanet.org/2018/08/candida-overgrowth-guide/">candida</a>,&nbsp;</strong>the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>acne
      on my face &amp; white spots on my back called <strong><a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.healthline.com/health/tinea-versicolor">tinea
      versicolour</a></strong>). The white spots Ive lived with for almost 15
      years. This diet healed all my skin conditions when I was 100% strict with
      it. No more acne or pimples anywhere. However when I do not take 100% care
      of myself (bad diet, stress, sweaty clothes, bad sleep) my skin tells me
      right away. I have it much better under control but it is fair to say: In
      order to have amazing skin you have to work on yourself. It is an ongoing
      process.</p><p>From the results I got from being on this diet, I learnt
      that the health of my skin has a direct correlation to the health of my
      gut environment. Overtime from taking too many anti-inflammatories,
      drinking alcohol and eating processed/sugary and fried foods, I developed
      an unhealthy gut environment. An unhealthy gut is the perfect breeding
      ground for bacteria and fungus that can have a really damaging effect on
      your skin. Before you can take back control of your skin you need to
      create a healthy gut environment and I believe the best and most effective
      way to do this is to go on a strict vegan/pescatarian candida diet. I am
      going to link a great article about what this diet includes and some
      recipes for you <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.thecandidadiet.com/candida-diet-vegan-vegetarian/"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a>!</p><p>Essentially
      a <strong><a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nutriplanet.org">vegan/pescatarian candida
      diet</a></strong> is a diet that restricts all processed food and all
      refined sugars/carbs. I was shocked that I wasn't allowed to eat fruit,
      even the sugar in fruit was feeding the bad bacteria in my gut. I was also
      shocked that after 2 years of being vegan and eating predominantly whole
      foods, my gut wasn't healthy already. The problem is sugar! Once you have
      bad bacteria in your gut it can survive for years even on a really healthy
      diet. All the bad bacteria needs is some white bread or a bit of pasta or
      pizza or some coconut ice cream and it will stay with you.</p><p>I wish I
      could say that you can have a cheat meal here and there, or eating a
      sugary dessert once a week is ok. But what I found was that as soon as I
      made one mistake and ate something I shouldn't have, my skin would flair
      up right away and I would need to start again from the
      beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>I am so confident that if you can stick to a full
      vegan/pescatarian candida diet for 1 month you will experience amazing
      results and your skin will be so much healthier than before. It was hard
      for me especially when Jake was having food I couldn't eat but it was so
      worth it in the long run. The good news is that after a few months now I
      have been able to re-introduce some foods that are not in the diet like
      bread/pizza and my skin won't flare up like it used to.</p><p>This is
      something that worked really well for me, it may not be the same for all
      of you but its worth a try. There is no downside to eating a really clean
      diet, only benefits. The hard part is having the willpower to stay strong
      when you're tempted to eat naughty food.</p><p>This solution might not be
      for you, in that case there are several other things that really helped
      me. I will list them below.&nbsp;</p>

      I can’t stress enough how important it is to nourish your body with food
      that comes from the earth that isn't full of chemicals and processed sugar
    body-content_html: >-
      <h3>What other solutions helped me on my journey to getting off the pill
      and fixing my skin?</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A good wholesome
      plant-based diet</strong></p><p>This won&rsquo;t come as a surprise. I
      can&rsquo;t stress enough how important it is to nourish your body with
      food that comes from the earth that isn't full of chemicals and processed
      sugar.</p><p>Even if you are not vegan or vegetarian, try to avoid
      processed food and refined sugars. This will make a huge
      difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Try to include in your diet more seeds, nuts,
      legumes and fresh veggies.</p><h4><strong>No sugar</strong></h4><p>Refined
      sugar is our number one enemy when it comes to health. Besides leading to
      heart diseases, increasing the risk of Type 2 diabetes, accelerating
      aging, etc. it also causes skin breakouts and acne.&nbsp;</p><p>Avoiding
      sugar has been one of the most challenging parts of this journey. Every
      time I was craving it I had to remind myself about the reason I was doing
      all this. In the end, it is just not worth it.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Drink
      a lot of water</strong></h4><p>Staying hydrated is extremely important for
      our bodies. This is what gives us life.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t drink
      enough water during the day, the skin is the first organ to suffer from
      it.&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure to drink at least 2 liters per day. And remember
      that when you feel thirsty you are already dehydrated and you are late. I
      carry a reusable bottle of water everywhere I go and I always keep it on
      the desk when I am working.</p><h4><strong>Apple cider
      vinegar</strong></h4><p>Apple cider vinegar was used as a natural remedy
      for health problems for a very long period of time. I incorporated it into
      my daily routine about a year ago. I mix it with water and drink it on an
      empty stomach every morning.&nbsp;</p><p>This has helped to not only clear
      out my skin but also improved my digestion and reduced
      bloating.</p><p>This is <a target="_blank"
      href="https://amzn.to/2yMhdZ4"><u>the one</u></a> I&rsquo;ve been
      using.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Probiotics</strong></h4><p>I can&rsquo;t
      stress enough how important your gut health is. If you have an imbalance
      in your gut, it prevents your body from absorbing and using the nutrients
      from your food, it also makes it difficult for your body to fight off
      viruses and infection. Probiotics will keep your&nbsp; gut healthy so you
      never need to worry about this. Probiotics will also reduce inflammation
      and help to get rid of the toxins which will have a beneficial effect on
      your skin.&nbsp;</p><p>You can either choose to buy them in capsules or
      you can include the following products in your diet: tempeh, kefir,
      yogurt, pickled veggies, miso, kimchi.</p><h4><strong>Less
      stress</strong></h4><p>It is no secret that stress is not good for us.
      Stress hormones affect all your hormones in general and this can cause
      breakouts.</p><p>Find the things that&nbsp; bring stress and anxiety into
      your life and see what changes you can make to minimise and eventually
      fully remove them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Sun and
      saltwater</strong></h4><p>I feel like it can be very personal, as
      I&rsquo;ve heard people say that saltwater dries out their skin. However,
      I feel that it has had a positive impact on my skin. Have you ever taken a
      dip in the ocean and noticed how quickly any cuts and scratches heal
      after? The ocean is full of bacteria that can help us heal. It will have
      the same effect on your face skin, especially if you picked any of the
      pimples.&nbsp;</p><p>The sun helps our body to produce vitamin D and
      serotonin, which is associated with lifting up our mood, relaxation and
      stress decrease.</p><p>But remember that everything is good in
      moderation.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Good sleep</strong></h4><p>I feel like
      this goes together with having less stress in your life. Sleep is the time
      when your body and mind rest and recover. A healthy amount of sleep is
      considered 8 hours per night. I know it is not always possible but it is
      all about balance. If one night you sleep less than you catch up the next
      night.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a good night of sleep by itself won&rsquo;t cure
      your acne but in combination with other things from this list, it can do
      wonders.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-cms-popout-id="image-1"

      /></p><h4><strong>No touching of the face</strong></h4><p>Most of the time
      we are doing this without even noticing. But imagine all the bacteria you
      are transferring from your hands onto your already inflamed skin. This is
      not good for your skin, try to avoid it as much as
      possible.</p><h4><strong>Use a clean towel</strong></h4><p>The same goes
      for using a clean face towel. Try to change it at least every 3 days but
      preferably every day. I suggest buying a set of small towels that will be
      used for face only, not even for your hands.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong><a
      target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WOBkxL"><u>Tea tree
      oil</u></a></strong></h4><p>This oil has a great anti-inflammatory effect.
      When I feel that I am about to get a pimple, I apply tea tree oil on that
      spot and it reduces the redness and sometimes the pimple won&rsquo;t even
      come out. I also find that it helps to prevent and reduce scarring and
      leave my skin smooth and soft.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong><a target="_blank"
      href="https://amzn.to/3fHFEI0"><u>Pure aloe
      vera</u></a></strong></h4><p>This is another great natural solution for
      scaring. I like applying it overnight. I only do it on the area where I
      have breakouts and I find that in the morning my skin looks much less
      inflamed.</p><p><img data-cms-popout-id="image-0"
      data-cms-original-src="/images/style/aloe-vera-maja.jpg" width="1600"

      /></p><h4><strong>Celery juice</strong></h4><p>Celery juice has a huge
      detoxifying and strengthening effect on our bodies. And naturally having
      less toxins in your body will have a positive effect on your skin. Celery
      juice is also high in sodium which raises stomach acids and it helps us to
      digest and to break down food fast. As a result, this leads to a healthy
      gut which we all know now has direct connection to the quality of our
      skin.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong><a target="_blank"
      href="https://amzn.to/3cq7RRp"><u>Hemp seed
      oil</u></a></strong></h4><p>Why hemp seed oil? Because it helps to
      moisturize our skin without clogging it and it is suitable for most skin
      types. Dryness can cause your skin to overproduce oil and this leads to
      more breakouts.</p>

      professionals:</h3><p>If you've tried coming off the pill and had
      struggles with your skin/rebalancing your hormones, you will know how
      difficult it is to find the answers you're looking for. Its especially
      hard because you want results to come NOW! I've found that there is no
      quick fix and the professionals in the field tend to say the same. Apart
      from the above things I've mentioned what else do the professionals
      say?</p><p><strong>Get your mineral levels tested:</strong> zinc, selenim,
      Vitamin D3, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Omega 3, Q10. In case you have
      deficiency consider supplementing certain essential minerals and
      vitamins.</p><p><strong>Take care of your liver -&nbsp;</strong>It is
      responsible for getting toxins out of our bodies. I&rsquo;ve already
      mentioned this a few times in the post, but only because it is this
      important. Fewer toxins = better skin.</p><p>Try to include in your diet
      more foods that have bitter substances in them (such as artichokes, sage
      and Brussel sprouts)</p><p>Also try to keep alcohol to a
      minimum.</p><p><strong>Good skincare</strong> - start paying more
      attention to the ingredients list of your skincare. General rule - if you
      can&rsquo;t pronounce it, it&rsquo;s not good for you. Try to avoid
      silicon, parabens, and alcohol as much as possible. Search for more
      natural ingredients, such as mentioned before - aloe vera, good oils
      (coconut, hemp, tea tree, argan, essential oils, etc), avocado, apple
      cider vinegar, etc.&nbsp;</p>

The past few months haven’t been easy and they have brought and will continue bringing a lot of changes to the world. We know that a lot of people have been feeling a lot of mixed emotions during this time - stress, anxiety, fear of uncertainty, helplessness, and loneliness. Trust us, in the beginning, we were there with you. Then we realized that this situation is fully out of our control and the only thing that is up to us is how we decide to feel about it. Instead of worrying about this that we can’t change, we decided to focus on gratitude and appreciation of what we already have.&nbsp;

Because things that bring us the most joy in life are not things. First and foremost we have each other and nothing can ever change that. We and our families are healthy and well, we have a beautiful place to stay at and healthy nutritious food on the table. And for this we are grateful.

Two months ago, when every day more and more countries were going into lock-down, we couldn’t decide what is the best place for us to be - Germany or maybe Australia, our apartment in Kuala Lumpur or Bali. But at the end of the day, we asked ourselves a question “where do we feel the most at home?” and the answer was clear - Bali.&nbsp;

We have been here for … months and we couldn’t be happier about our decision. Even though there have been a lot of changes on the island, we still think this is the best place for us to spend the quarantine.&nbsp;

So as in the rest of the world, there have been a lot of changes in Indonesia and in Bali in particular. We know that a lot of you had to cancel your travel plans to come here. We have also received questions with regard to the current situation on the island.

So in this post, we want to tell you all about it and we will also talk about different ways we can do to support the locals.

### What has changed in Bali during the quarantine

* Indonesian authorities issued public guidelines where they asked everybody to stay home as much as possible. We can go outside for groceries, to the pharmacy, and in case of an emergency.
* If we need to go outside we have to wear masks at all times.&nbsp;
* Most of the cafes, bars, and restaurants were closed but since a few days ago some of them start to slowly open back up again.
* Take-away and delivery are still possible.
* All beached, gyms, SPA’s on the island are closed until the end of May.
* All airports and seaports are closed until the 1st of June and the government might extend it in case of an increase of new COVID-19 cases.&nbsp;
* The streets are very quiet, there is no traffic and you can see very few people outside.
* There are no tourists on the island. Those who are here are either locals or foreigners who permanently live in Bali.
* The government has granted emergency visas until the lock-down is over to all those who didn’t manage to return to their home countries.&nbsp;

If you want to follow official news from Indonesian government we advise you to check out those websites:

* [<u>Bali Hotel Association</u>](https://www.balihotelsassociation.com/important-updates/thesituation/){: target="_blank"}
* [<u>Map and data showing cases in Bali</u>](https://pendataan.baliprov.go.id/){: target="_blank"}
* [<u>Ministry of Health Indonesia</u>](https://infeksiemerging.kemkes.go.id/){: target="_blank"}
* [<u>Ministry of Foreign Affairs&nbsp;</u>](https://kemlu.go.id/portal/en/berita){: target="_blank"}
* [<u>World Health Organisation</u>](https://www.who.int/){: target="_blank"}

Bali locals are being hit much harder than other places by this lockdown because of their reliance on the tourism industry.&nbsp;

If you follow us on Instagram you will know about our DOGOOD Monday’s. If not, this is something we have been doing for over a year now. Basically, every Monday we try to do something good for someone else. In the past few weeks, we’ve been sharing programs, foundations and different ways you can help to support the local economy. Even the smallest contribution can make a huge difference to a local family or business.&nbsp;

### How can you help

* @crisiskitchen\_bali - they deliver meals every day to families in Bali that desperately need it. They work together with communities and other cafes that donate food to those most in need. If you love Bali and you are able to help, check out their [<u>Gofundme page</u>](https://www.gofundme.com/f/crisis-kitchen-bali){: target="_blank"}.

* ‘Adopt a Balinese family in need’ program - [<u>The Ananda team</u>](https://www.anandasoul.com/products/support-a-balinese-family){: target="_blank"} will use 100% of your donations to buy the contents of the care packages and distribute them amongst the families in their villages who are most in need. It is 15$ for a family for a week.

* Adopt a dog - let’s not forget about our four-pawed friends. Balinese families are struggling to feed themselves not to talk about all street animals. You can donate to rescue, rehabilitate or re-home dogs or other animals in need.

Here are a few foundations you can check out - @thepaws.co, @bawabali\_official, @hopeforbalidogs, @bali.paws.
