The past few months haven’t been easy and they have brought and will continue bringing a lot of changes to the world. We know that a lot of people have been feeling a lot of mixed emotions during this time - stress, anxiety, fear of uncertainty, helplessness, and loneliness. Trust us, in the beginning, we were there with you. Then we realized that this situation is fully out of our control and the only thing that is up to us is how we decide to feel about it. Instead of worrying about this that we can’t change, we decided to focus on gratitude and appreciation of what we already have.&nbsp;

Because things that bring us the most joy in life are not things. First and foremost we have each other and nothing can ever change that. We and our families are healthy and well, we have a beautiful place to stay at and healthy nutritious food on the table. And for this we are grateful.

Two months ago, when every day more and more countries were going into lock-down, we couldn’t decide what is the best place for us to be - Germany or maybe Australia, our apartment in Kuala Lumpur or Bali. But at the end of the day, we asked ourselves a question “where do we feel the most at home?” and the answer was clear - Bali.&nbsp;

We have been here for … months and we couldn’t be happier about our decision. Even though there have been a lot of changes on the island, we still think this is the best place for us to spend the quarantine.&nbsp;

So as in the rest of the world, there have been a lot of changes in Indonesia and in Bali in particular. We know that a lot of you had to cancel your travel plans to come here. We have also received questions with regard to the current situation on the island.

So in this post, we want to tell you all about it and we will also talk about different ways we can do to support the locals.

### What has changed in Bali during the quarantine

* Indonesian authorities issued public guidelines where they asked everybody to stay home as much as possible. We can go outside for groceries, to the pharmacy, and in case of an emergency.
* If we need to go outside we have to wear masks at all times.&nbsp;
* Most of the cafes, bars, and restaurants were closed but since a few days ago some of them start to slowly open back up again.
* Take-away and delivery are still possible.
* All beached, gyms, SPA’s on the island are closed until the end of May.
* All airports and seaports are closed until the 1st of June and the government might extend it in case of an increase of new COVID-19 cases.&nbsp;
* The streets are very quiet, there is no traffic and you can see very few people outside.
* There are no tourists on the island. Those who are here are either locals or foreigners who permanently live in Bali.
* The government has granted emergency visas until the lock-down is over to all those who didn’t manage to return to their home countries.&nbsp;

If you want to follow official news from Indonesian government we advise you to check out those websites:

* [<u>Map and data showing cases in Bali</u>](https://pendataan.baliprov.go.id/){: target="_blank"}
* [<u>Ministry of Health Indonesia</u>](https://infeksiemerging.kemkes.go.id/){: target="_blank"}
* [<u>Ministry of Foreign Affairs&nbsp;</u>](https://kemlu.go.id/portal/en/berita){: target="_blank"}
* [<u>World Health Organisation</u>](https://www.who.int/){: target="_blank"}

Bali locals are being hit much harder than other places by this lockdown because of their reliance on the tourism industry.&nbsp;

### How can you help

* @crisiskitchen\_bali - they deliver meals every day to families in Bali that desperately need it. They work together with communities and other cafes that donate food to those most in need. If you love Bali and you are able to help, check out their [<u>Gofundme page</u>](https://www.gofundme.com/f/crisis-kitchen-bali){: target="_blank"}.

* ‘Adopt a Balinese family in need’ program - [<u>The Ananda team</u>](https://www.anandasoul.com/products/support-a-balinese-family){: target="_blank"} will use 100% of your donations to buy the contents of the care packages and distribute them amongst the families in their villages who are most in need. It is 15$ for a family for a week.

* Adopt a dog - let’s not forget about our four-pawed friends. Balinese families are struggling to feed themselves not to talk about all street animals. You can donate to rescue, rehabilitate or re-home dogs or other animals in need.
