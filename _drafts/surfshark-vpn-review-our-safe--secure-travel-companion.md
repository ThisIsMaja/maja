intro-content_html: >-
  <p>We have a confession to make. There was a time when we had no idea what a
  VPN was or why we would need to use one - until we discovered Surfshark. We
  want to share our Surfshark VPN review with you to explain more about
  VPN&rsquo;s and how they can come in handy, especially when
  travelling!&nbsp;</p><p>You might be asking &lsquo;what on earth is a
  VPN?&rsquo;. VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It is a service that
  allows you to connect to the internet securely, giving you privacy and
  protecting your data.&nbsp;</p><p>We actually started using the Surfshark VPN
  to get our fix of Australian Netflix whilst in Indonesia!&nbsp;</p><p>Without
  a VPN it&rsquo;s only possible to access the Netflix library of whichever
  country you are in at the time which can be pretty limiting if you want to
  catch up on your favourite shows from back home.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot
  more that a VPN can do, so keep reading our Surfshark VPN review to find out
  all about the cool features that it has and also about our own personal
  experience using this service.</p>
