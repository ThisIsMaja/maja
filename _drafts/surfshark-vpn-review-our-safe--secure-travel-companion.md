intro-content_html: >-
  <p>We have a confession to make. There was a time when we had no idea what a
  VPN was or why we would need to use one. We want to share our Surfshark VPN
  review with you to explain more about VPN&rsquo;s and how they can come in
  handy, especially when travelling!&nbsp;</p><p>You might be asking &lsquo;what
  on earth is a VPN?&rsquo;. VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It is a
  service that allows you to connect to the internet securely, giving you
  privacy and protecting your data.&nbsp;</p><p>We actually started using the
  Surfshark VPN to get our fix of Netflix whilst in
  Indonesia!&nbsp;</p><p>Without a VPN it&rsquo;s only possible to access the
  Netflix library of whichever country you are in at the time which can be
  pretty limiting if you want to catch up on your favourite shows from back
  home.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot more that a VPN can do, so keep reading our
  Surfshark VPN review to find out all about the cool features that it has and
  also about our own personal experience using this service.</p>

      <h2 class="emphasis">What does a VPN do?</h2><p>The two big draw cards of
      using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener sponsored"
      href="https://surfshark.com/">Surfshark VPN service</a> are to protect
      your security and privacy online.</p><p>A VPN can help you shield your
      online presence in many different ways. It encrypts your personal
      information and sends it via a secure VPN tunnel meaning no-one unwanted
      can see it.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of this, ads, trackers and malware are
      blocked, online banking and managing crypto assets is more secure, using
      public WiFi is more safe and when you&rsquo;re gaming your personal
      information is protected.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of us spend 6-8 hours per day
      online searching, browsing and using websites, and these websites end up
      learning a lot of information about us! If you care about securing your
      digital life and protecting your identity then using a VPN is a
      no-brainer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If that&rsquo;s not enough to convince you
      why using a VPN can be worthwhile, we can tell you that it can also
      improve your digital experience and even save you money!</p>

      <h2 class="emphasis">How having a VPN saves us money on travel</h2><p>Who
      knew that a VPN could come in so handy while
      travelling!&nbsp;</p><p>Surfshark does a lot more than just allow you to
      watch your favourite shows abroad.&nbsp;</p><p>We are going to tell you
      about some amazing travel hacks that you can achieve by using
      Surfshark&rsquo;s VPN.</p><h3>Surfshark VPN helps you unlock better
      prices</h3><p>It&rsquo;s a known fact that people in different countries
      see different prices for things. If this comes as a shock to you, well now
      you know that price discrimination is a real thing!&nbsp;</p><p>Using the
      Surfshark VPN you can actually get better prices for things like flights
      accommodation and car rentals just by switching up which country you
      search from.&nbsp;</p><p>All you need to do is check the price without
      using Surfshark, make a note of it and then close the
      page.&nbsp;</p><p>Then turn on Surfshark and choose a server that&rsquo;s
      in a different country than the country you are in.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally,
      you open an incognito window and go to the same website and re-check the
      price.&nbsp;</p><p>If you can see a change in price then you can now see
      the difference between what something would have cost in one country
      versus another.&nbsp;</p><p>You can keep checking the price by selecting
      different servers until you find the best price. Crazy isn&rsquo;t
      it!</p><h3>Surfshark VPN saves mobile roaming data</h3><p>A fact that
      might not be so widely known is that loading ads and banners uses a lot of
      data. We definitely didn&rsquo;t know this!&nbsp;</p><p>With Surfshark
      there is a feature you can turn on that saves up to 40% of roaming data
      and increases the speed of your internet, saving you money on global
      roaming.&nbsp;</p><p>This was useful for us when we were based in
      Australia and had Australian sim cards which we travelled with.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Using Surfshark with Netflix</h2><p>As I mentioned, the original
      reason Marie and I started using Surfshark was to access content from our
      Netflix account that wasn&rsquo;t available to us when we were travelling
      in Bali.&nbsp;</p><p>This happens because streaming platforms, such as
      Netflix, don&rsquo;t offer the exact same content in all countries due to
      licensing.&nbsp;</p><p>So, even though we pay the monthly fee with
      Netflix, without a VPN we can only access the films and series available
      in the country we are actually in at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>We have an
      Australian Netflix account because we signed up to the service when we
      were living in Australia.&nbsp;</p><p>When we use the Surfshark VPN we can
      access the entire Netflix catalogue from anywhere in the world, so we
      never miss out!</p><p>We mostly use Surfshark&rsquo;s VPN on our laptops
      and mobile phones but it can also be used on tablets, smart TV&rsquo;s,
      Xbox and Playstation and other devices using their Smart DNS feature.</p>

      <h2>Is Surfshark safe and reliable?</h2><p>Surfshark is one of the best
      VPNs out there at the moment. We think it&rsquo;s pretty powerful and
      offers reliable online security and privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>It has a few
      technical features which are worth talking about for those of you that
      want to know a little bit more about what it&rsquo;s capable
      of.</p><h3>Hacklock ID Protection</h3><p>Surfshark VPN will actually
      notify you if your email address or password get leaked.</p><h3>Clean
      Web</h3><p>Because ads, trackers, malware and phishing attempts are all
      blocked you can surf the internet in peace.&nbsp;</p><p>The stripping back
      of all of these things is the way that you also save on mobile data and
      boost your browsing speeds as I mentioned above.</p><h3>Kill
      Switch</h3><p>The VPN Kill Switch will automatically disconnect you from
      the internet if your VPN connection drops unexpectedly.&nbsp;</p><p>This
      means that you can feel sure that your personal information and data is
      protected at all times.</p><h3>No borders mode</h3><p>Surfshark VPN lets
      you unblock websites and apps by accessing streaming sites, by-passing
      geo-restrictions and gets you around censorship.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;ve
      already talked about how we use the VPN to watch Netflix but you can do
      the same thing with ESPN, Disney Plus and so many more.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus,
      if you&rsquo;re travelling to a country like China where there are
      restrictions on what websites and apps you can access and the media is
      censored you can use Surfshark VPN to access everything freely and
      anonymously.</p><h3>Whitelister</h3><p>Whitelister is Surfshark&rsquo;s
      way of enabling split tunneling.&nbsp;</p><p>Basically, this allows you to
      have some of your internet traffic go over VPN and the rest go over the
      internet as normal.&nbsp;</p><p>So, you can be using the Surfshark VPN and
      the normal internet at the same time without
      disconnecting.&nbsp;</p><p>This comes in handy as some banking websites
      don&rsquo;t work with a VPN or you might need to access connected devices
      such as a printer that doesn&rsquo;t require a VPN
      connection.</p><p>Whitelister gives you the power to choose what apps and
      websites are protected by the Surfshark VPN without turning it on and
      off.</p>

      <h2>Does Surfshark keep logs of your online activity?</h2><p>Did you know
      that your Internet Service Provider (ISP) can see all the websites you
      visit and things you download? Scary right!</p><p>They are also required
      to store this information for years and in some countries can even sell
      the data if it&rsquo;s anonymised.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re using a VPN then
      it&rsquo;s likely you want to protect your personal information and data
      so it&rsquo;s also important to choose a VPN that doesn&rsquo;t collect
      and store these. Surfshark VPN is a no log VPN, meaning it does not
      collect details like IP address, browsing history, used bandwidth, session
      information, network traffic and connection timestamps.</p><p>You can use
      Surfshark&rsquo;s Blind Search organic search tool with no ads or tracking
      to browse. Your online activity is totally private.</p><h2>Can Surfshark
      be used on multiple devices?</h2><p>Surfshark VPN is great because you can
      use it on unlimited devices all at the same time. No other VPN currently
      allows this!&nbsp;</p><p>We&rsquo;ve found it really useful as between
      Marie and I we have more than four devices and anyone in our team can use
      it too!</p><h2>Surfshark free trial</h2><p>If you&rsquo;ve never used a
      VPN and you want to test one out before committing long-term, Surfshark
      VPN offers a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener sponsored"
      href="https://surfshark.com/vpn-free-trial">30-day risk-free
      guarantee</a>.</p><p>You will need to create a Surfshark account and pay
      the first installment after which you can use and test Surfshark VPN for
      30 days.</p><p>At 30 days you can decide if you want to cancel your
      subscription and get a full refund or continue your subscription and keep
      using Surfshark.</p><h3>Use the MAJA discount code</h3><p><a

      <h2>Surfshark VPN Review final thoughts</h2><p>Marie and I have been using
      Surfshark now for a little while and it&rsquo;s come in so handy for both
      travel and business.</p><p>Having something that our extended team can use
      since we are usually not all in the same country at the same time is
      amazing too.</p><p>The benefits that come with using Surfshark VPN beyond
      the privacy and security are like added bonuses - it&rsquo;s definitely
      helped save us a bit of money and we even get our fix of Aussie Netflix
      whilst on the road!&nbsp;</p>
