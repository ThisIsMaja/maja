  <p>We arrived in Athens Greece on the 16th of August 2020 in the middle of the
  global pandemic that has seen many countries close their borders and enforce
  lockdowns.&nbsp;</p><p>We've been following the news for the past 5 months and
  if we hadn't left our home we might have believed in all the doom and gloom.
  But now that we have left Bali and flown across the world to Greece, we can
  assure you that the world is still turning and things are more normal than you
  might expect.&nbsp;</p><p>While we absolutely recommend that we act
  responsibly and safe, we don't think that locking ourselves down and waiting
  for the corona virus to disappear is anything close to a solution. Without
  succumbing to fear a better solution would be to accept this virus might be
  around for a while and put into place measures to combat it while regaining
  our lives and the global economy.</p>
