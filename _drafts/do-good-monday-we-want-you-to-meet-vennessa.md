  Being a black travel blogger and being able to go abroad my hope was that I
  could share my travel experience with a wide audience of POC so that they
  would be inspired to do the same.

  <p>Hi I'm Vennessa. I'm from the beautiful island of Jamaica. Like a lot of
  other families;&nbsp; my family migrated to the USA for a better life.
  Entering America I pursued a career as a Registered Nurse. While being a Nurse
  I got to experience a lot of different cultures and decided to take on the
  task of being a travel blogger. With a curious mind it was no surprise to my
  family when I took on the journey to explore the world; whilst caring and
  helping people along the way. My goal is to inspire as many people as I can so
  they too will want to explore this beautiful world we get to call home.</p>
