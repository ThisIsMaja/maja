  In all honesty we used to believe that supplements were completely unnecessary
  and that most supplements have no benefits whatsoever - (we still believe the
  latter).

  <p>The supplement industry is full of misinformation and false claims. When it
  comes to food supplements there is also very little regulation in terms of
  ingredient quality before products are released onto the shelves. With this in
  mind we really wanted to put in the research to find out what supplements we
  actually needed, which supplements would actually work and which supplement
  companies had the best intentions and weren&rsquo;t just out to make a quick
  buck.&nbsp;</p><p>It took a while but we eventually found the company, the
  product and the results we were looking for in <a target="_blank"
  href="https://bit.ly/futurekind">FUTURE KIND</a>. Before we get into which
  supplements we take and why, we want to give you a little back story.</p>

      But it is not only this diet that has changed our lives for the better, it
      is our consciousness towards what we put into our bodies
    body-content_html: >-
      <p>Living on a plant-based diet for the past 4 years has improved our
      lives immensely. We&rsquo;ve experienced so much more energy, focus, drive
      and vitality since we swapped out all animal products and most processed
      foods in exchange for a whole plant based diet. It is hard to overstate
      the positive impact this diet and this way of life has had on our overall
      happiness and success. But it is not only this diet that has changed our
      lives for the better, it is our consciousness towards what we put into our
      bodies and our focus on giving our bodies the nutrients we really need to
      thrive.</p><p>We were thriving for 3 years on a plant-based diet before we
      noticed a small decline in our energy and our focus. We had always been
      conscious of what we were eating and we tried our best to eat a variety of
      plant based foods. But travelling full time and spending time in countries
      with very little plant based options made it difficult for us to cover all
      the nutrients we needed through food alone. This is when we started
      researching into supplementation and we learnt that with the right
      products, made by the right companies, we could take a daily supplement
      that would ensure all our nutrient needs were being met. If you travel a
      lot like us, or you have a really busy schedule, or you just want to make
      sure you&rsquo;re operating at 100%. Supplementing can help you stay
      healthy and at the top of your game (if you use the right products and
      supplement with the nutrients you actually need)</p>

      there are 3 main nutrients/vitamins that we do find hard to get especially
      when we don't have access to a wide range of foods.
    body-content_html: >-
      <h3><strong>What nutrients do we need to supplement as plant based eaters
      and why?</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In healthy people, the majority of
      scientific evidence shows that taking a multivitamin isn&rsquo;t necessary
      and that some might even be doing you HARM. That&rsquo;s because they
      contain vitamins and minerals that you&rsquo;re probably already getting
      enough of.</p><p>Being plant based we get significantly more nutrients
      than an average person on an average western diet. But there are 3 main
      nutrients/vitamins that we do find hard to get especially when we don't
      have access to a wide range of foods.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>They are
      vitamins B12, D3 and Omega 3&rsquo;s EPA and DHA</strong></p><p>We don't
      get enough of these because these nutrients come from bacteria, the sun's
      rays, and algae &mdash; things we do not always consume a lot of. The
      reason why it can be easier on a normal diet is because fish contains
      Omega 3&rsquo;s which they get from the algae. Other meat products like
      chicken and beef contain B12 because the animals get it from bacteria in
      the soil. Animals do not make these nutrients, they also get it from other
      places. When we consume animal products we can get these nutrients but
      they generally come with a whole host of bad stuff like saturated fat,
      cholesterol, heme iron, mercury etc.</p>

      <h3><strong>Why do we take vitamin B12, D3 and omega 3's EPA and
      DHA?</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that apart from
      vitamin B12 most people including those who eat high animal protein diets,
      are not getting enough of these nutrients which look after our brains and
      other vital systems in our bodies. A daily supplement with these 3
      nutrients for anybody can enhance so many areas of life
      including:</p><p><strong>Supporting our energy levels</strong></p><p>B12
      is essential for energy production and for maintaining a healthy nervous
      system. Up to 92% of vegans are not getting enough B12. A B12 deficiency
      can lead to serious and irreversible conditions.</p><p><strong>Enhancing
      our ability to focus</strong></p><p>Omega-3 has been extensively
      researched, and several studies have found benefits for both memory and
      "mental flexibility". Some preliminary research suggests that B12 might
      also help with cognition.</p><p><strong>Improving our
      mood</strong></p><p>Omega-3 acids have been shown to be promising natural
      treatments for mood disorders. More than 30 clinical trials have been
      undertaken on those with depression, and they have found that Omega-3 is
      generally beneficial.</p><p><strong>Vital for immunity</strong></p><p>B12,
      Vitamin D and Omega-3 are essential for the proper maintenance of your
      immune system, helping your body defend against
      viruses.</p><p><strong>Increasing our lifespan</strong></p><p>Vitamin D3
      (which is the type we use) has been found to reduce mortality rates and
      therefore increase lifespan. Vitamin D2 on the other hand, which is what
      most supplement brands use, didn't have the same
      benefit.</p><p><strong>Protecting our brain</strong></p><p>Several studies
      found that the Omega-3 fatty acids EPA &amp; DHA help preserve our brain
      size as we age. From the age of 20, our brains begin to shrink, so it's
      important to get enough Omega-3.</p><p><strong>Supporting healthy
      joints</strong></p><p>Omega-3 has been found in several studies to help
      reduce joint pain. This was supported in a 12 month, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study.</p><p><strong>Promoting our eye
      health</strong></p><p>Several studies have found that supplementing with
      Omega-3 can help alleviate symptoms of dry eye. One study focused on
      people that use a computer for longer than 3 hours a day, and found that
      after daily supplementation, they experienced less dry
      eye.</p><p><strong>Supporting healthy bones</strong></p><p>Adequate intake
      of Vitamin D is essential for maintaining healthy bones, as it helps with
      calcium and phosphorous absorption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
