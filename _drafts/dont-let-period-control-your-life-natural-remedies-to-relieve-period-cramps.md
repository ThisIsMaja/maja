  Over the last few weeks we have been getting many questions on travel - when
  we will travel, what it will look like, and how the industry will manage
  during this pandemic.
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>This is the longest period in four years that we haven&rsquo;t travelled,
  so it has been a major change for us!&nbsp; We know many of you share our
  passion for travel so it&rsquo;s something on all our minds.&nbsp;</p><p>We
  don&rsquo;t have all the answers right now, we are letting the health experts
  lead the way. But, one thing we do know is that the coronavirus restrictions
  will be a reality for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While countries around the
  world have been locked down for months now, we are slowly starting to see
  things open up around the world, but leisure travel has still pretty much
  screeched to a halt for now.&nbsp; Countries are handling the pandemic
  differently so it&rsquo;s important to follow guidance issued by your own
  government agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>We wanted to take the time to answer some of
  your burning questions related to travel the best we can!&nbsp;</p>

      know when we will travel, as we will only travel when it is safe and
      responsible to do so.&nbsp; We have postponed our travel plans
      indefinitely, and will follow the guidelines to learn when is a good time
      to rebook. We have been staying close to the updates to learn more about
      how travel will change due to the coronavirus. We want to ensure we are
      informed, and make well balanced decisions when the time
      comes!&nbsp;</p><p>The first thing we will do when the borders open up is
      visit our families in Australia and Germany.&nbsp;</p>

      We think travel will look significantly different when it comes time to
      hop on a flight again.
    body-content_html: >-
      <h3><strong>How will we travel again</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We know
      airlines and hotels around the world have been working to implement new
      policies and measures to protect guests and limit the spread of the virus.
      We think travel will look significantly different when it comes time to
      hop on a flight again.</p><p><strong><em>Airlines</em></strong></p><p>Many
      airlines have already made significant changes to the onboard
      experience.&nbsp; They are implementing things like:</p><ul><li>Mandatory
      Personal Protective Equipment: In some countries, and on certain airlines,
      masks/face coverings are now mandatory onboard for both passengers and
      crew.&nbsp; Cabin crew are provided with personal protective equipment
      such as masks, eye shields, gloves, and in some cases even hazmat suits.
      This is to protect the safety of the cabin crew who are frontline workers,
      and also to protect passengers and limit the spread of the virus.&nbsp; If
      you are travelling, ensure you check the airline guidelines as you could
      be denied boarding if you fail to wear a mask.&nbsp;</li><li>Reduced
      in-flight service:&nbsp; To limit interactions between passengers and
      crew, onboard service has been limited across many airlines. You will see
      pre-packaged kits that contain beverage and food combined, similar to a
      paper-bag lunch. Certain airlines have been placing water bottles on the
      seats prior to boarding in order to limit contact
      in-flight.</li><li>Reduced passenger loads: To promote physical distancing
      on flights, many airlines have reduced the maximum capacity of their
      flights, blocking out the middle seats to increase space around
      passengers. Other airlines have changed their booking policy, to allow
      increased flexibility - if a flight is full, you can rebook at no cost for
      a more empty flight.&nbsp;</li><li>Health screening before boarding: Many
      airlines have upped their screening procedures to ensure passengers that
      are exhibiting any symptoms, such as fever or cough, are not permitted to
      fly. You may have your temperature checked before
      boarding.</li><li>Contactless check-in: Many airlines have already adopted
      this process, but contactless check-in will become a normal procedure at
      airports around the world.&nbsp;</li><li>More connections: Route networks
      have been changed as a result of coronavirus. Many routes have been
      cancelled indefinitely which means more connections as direct flights may
      no longer be available.&nbsp;</li><li>More expensive: There is a chance
      that airline tickets will become more expensive. Because passenger loads
      will be significantly lower, airlines may raise ticket prices in order to
      ensure the route is profitable, when operating at a 50% passenger
      load.&nbsp; That being said, some experts disagree and suggest flying will
      actually be cheaper as airlines face unprecedented financial
      pressures.</li><li>Advanced onboard sanitizing: Airlines have been
      implementing increased measures to clean and sanitize the aircrafts. Some
      have even hired a new onboard position to have a crew member designated to
      monitor the use of lavatories and sanitize after every
      use.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><em>Hotels</em></p><ul><li>Reduced capacity: Some
      hotels have been implementing processes in which only certain floors and
      rooms are booked, to ensure more physical distancing and allowing more
      time for cleaning in between guests.</li><li>Increased technology: As a
      cost saving measure, you may see increased technology at hotels that are
      used to limit staffing needs. Similar to airlines, self-check in may be a
      new thing at more hotels.&nbsp;</li><li>No more mini-bars: Many hotels
      have removed mini-bars and complimentary coffee stations from rooms, and
      we probably won&rsquo;t see these return in the near
      future.&nbsp;</li><li>Temperature checks: Similar to airlines, many hotels
      are performing temperature checks upon entry.&nbsp;</li></ul>

      <h3><strong>Where will we travel?</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are

### Hot water bottle

I find that applying heat on my belly and back helps significantly with period cramps. You can buy one of those special warm bottles online. Or you can also make it yourself by putting uncooked rice into a sock and microwaving it for a few minutes. Make sure you don’t overheat either of those. It should be slighter warmer than your own body temperature.&nbsp;

### Herbs & Spices

Together with applying some heat on your body, you can try to enjoy a cup of warm herbal tea. The easiest tea that I like to make is hot water with some lemon and ginger. I might also add mint if I have it.

There are also some specific herbs that are proven to have an anti-inflammatory effect on our bodies. These are chamomile, fennel seeds, cinnamon and dill. You can drink them on their own or create your own tea-mix.

A great spice with the same effect is turmeric. You can try adding it to your meals or having it together with some warm milk.

### CBD oil

**@Marie:** I wasn’t sure how exactly you wanted to present/write about cbd oil, so I left it empty for you to fill in.

### Self-massage with essential oils

I found that giving my abdominals, sides and back a gentle massage with a right combination of essential oils helps me to relax and reduce the pain. You can find videos on YouTube, which show specific points that you can press on your body to make the massage even more effective. Or you can simply rub your belly in slow gentle circular motion.&nbsp;

As for essential oils, try to mix a few of your favorite aromas. In general, lavender, clary sage and marjoram are considered to be the relaxing ones. You might want to give them a try first and at the end come up with your own perfect combo.&nbsp;

### Healthy diet&nbsp;

This won’t immediately relieve period cramps but it may have a positive effect over time.&nbsp;

Try including more omega-3 reach foods in your diet and avoid having foods that make you bloat and retain water.&nbsp;

You can find out more about the benefits of omega-3 and supplements you might want to include in your diet in this blog post (\*we include a link here to a blog post about supplements).&nbsp;

Regarding the foods you want to avoid during your period, the list can vary per person but in general, those are:

* Alcohol, fizzy drinks and coffee
* Salty and sugary foods
* Too many fruits can cause bloating. You can replace them with berries instead.&nbsp;
* Fatty and highly processed food

### Magnesium

Magnesium is a mineral that plays an important role in hundreds of important chemical reactions in our bodies. Despite that, it is considered that most of the population is magnesium deficient.&nbsp;

One of the benefits of magnesium is the regulation of the nervous system and muscle recovery. It calms your nerves, reduces stress, and relaxes your muscles. A lot of studies have proven that magnesium helps to reduce period cramps and improves PMS symptoms. The difference between regular pain-killers is that it doesn’t work immediately. Your body has to build it up over time. So it might take 1-3 months before you’ll see the results but the benefits are absolutely worth it.&nbsp;

### Gentle exercises&nbsp;

I know it can be unbearable to imagine doing any sort of exercise when the only thing you want to do is lie in bed. The keyword here is “gentle”. Try doing slow stretching and soft yoga flow laying on your back. This will help blood circulation and the release of endorphins.

In this blog post, we talk about which supplements you should take if you are on a plant-based diet and why. We also share the best vegan supplements.
