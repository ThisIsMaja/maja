I get so many questions from girls about how did I grow my online confidence and stopped being afraid of the camera, that I decided to dedicate the whole post to this topic.&nbsp;

Especially at the beginning, it wasn’t easy so I can totally imagine how you feel. We all have insecurities about ourselves and we are afraid of being judged for them. The Internet is a cool and fun place to be but it can also be hurtful sometimes. You have to grow some skin in order to withstand some of the opinions people share online. On the other hand, we’ve been blessed to have the kindest, most genuine, and warm-hearted online community. You guys are the best and we can’t put into words how grateful we are for every single one of you.&nbsp;

I will share with you all the things I did that helped me build my online confidence.&nbsp;

* ### The power of visualization&nbsp;

We all know, that what we think we become. If you imagine yourself being a confident person, your mind will believe it and soon enough you will also start acting this way. Just close your eyes and imagine yourself confidently walking down the street and being proud of who you are. Give yourself a compliment every time you look in the mirror. I like to leave a little post-it on our bathroom mirror with a positive affirmation. So every time I or Jake walk in there it serves as a little reminder for some self-love.&nbsp;

Little things like that will help you create a new vision of yourself. You will see yourself as a self-assured, positive, and beautiful human being, who is ready to conquer the world.

* ### Journal and write down what you like about yourself

I and Jake try to journal 5-10 minutes every morning. We use this time to write down our thoughts, things we are grateful for, and things we want to achieve.

It is one thing to have thoughts in your head and totally different when you write them down on a piece of paper. Suddenly, they become so much more real. I suggest you dedicate some time to sitting down and list everything you like about yourself. Don’t be shy and write down everything that comes to mind. From the way you look to the things you do or say. It can be anything\! Write it down\!

Trust me, once you see all those things in front of you, you can’t help but feel good about yourself.&nbsp;

* ### Ask close ones what they like about you the most

I know a lot of people find it difficult to accept compliments but this is something different. Ask this question to the people who are the closest to you and whose opinion you value. Ask them to name things about you that they think make you a great human being. Why do they love you and what qualities do they like the most in you.

Hearing those things from people you care will for sure help to boost your confidence.

* ### Practice being in front of the camera

It is true that practice makes perfect. In order to get used to being on camera, you have to actually start being on camera. Start with taking pictures and recording videos of yourself as if you were going to post them online. The more you’ll do it the more confident you’ll become. Watch back all the videos and photos you took and see which ones you like the most. See how you looked on them, what pose you like the most, and try to repeat it the next time you start shooting again.&nbsp;

After you took hundreds of photos and recorder hours of videos, you will get so used to being on camera that you won’t even notice it.

* ### Be okay with not being perfect (people like honesty)

We are all humans and nobody is perfect, and it is the beauty of this world. You don’t have to reshoot the whole video because you forgot that one word or didn’t notice a piece of hair sticking out. All this makes you real.&nbsp;

If you messed up, laugh about it and people will laugh with you. If your eyes are half-closed but the photo represents your true emotions, post it anyway. All those little “imperfections” will bring you closer to your audience, trust me.

* ### Accept that you will start as a beginner and know that practice makes you a pro

It kinda goes along with the previous point but I wanted to put it separately so that I can stress out one thing. Please don’t put the pressure on yourself to get it perfectly right from the beginning. Don’t try to control your every move and every word. It is very obvious to your viewers and it will only make it worst. Try to relax as much as possible and let everything come naturally. Experience comes with time and you will get there if you keep trying.

* ### If you’re a perfectionist: plan your content in advance

If for example, you want to post more on Instagram Story but the fact that your video is not perfect stops you from posting it, then change it. Record it as many times as you need to be happy with it.

Plan your content in advance, search for locations, pick your outfits, and write down what you want to say. If being as prepared as possible takes the stress away then do it.&nbsp;

When we go to a new location, we like to do research in advance and have a few ideas in mind. This saves us a lot of time and removes unnecessary worries.&nbsp;

All those things have helped me and I am sure they can help you as well. Remember that you are beautiful the way you are. You don’t have to pretend and try to be somebody else. There is an audience for everyone and you will find your niche once you get out there. Don’t be afraid to be yourself, stay positive and practice, practice, practice.
