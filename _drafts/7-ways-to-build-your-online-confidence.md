intro-paragraph-emphasis: Midway through 2018 I finally decided to get off the pill once and for all
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>From the moment I made that decision I have been fighting a constant battle
  to rebalance my hormones and regain the healthy skin I once had. It has been a
  tiring process and I almost gave in several times to the allure of clean skin
  by manipulating my hormones with the &lsquo;pill&rsquo;. In this blog post I'm
  not going to talk about why the pill is bad for you or why I decided to quit.
  At this point I just want to share with you how I succeeded at rebalancing my
  hormones and how I brought my skin back under control. Keep reading to find
  out how : )</p><p>This is for all you girls out there who want to get off the
  pill but you have struggled with skin issues every time you try. I want you to
  believe there is a way for you to regain your healthy skin and say goodbye to
  the horrible pill for good. I can tell you now with patience and commitment
  you can do it. And I am confident that with the right information and learning
  from my mistakes you can do it much quicker.&nbsp;</p><p>It for sure
  hasn&rsquo;t been easy and I've tried almost every treatment you can think of.
  From different diets, medications and home remedies to staying out of the sun
  or covering my face in apple cider vinegar. I tried it all and I finally found
  a remedy for me. Now I know what I need to do to control my skin, but that
  doesn't mean my skin is always perfect. It just means that I know why my skin
  goes bad when it does, and I know how to fix it.</p><p>If you struggle with
  any sort of skin issue you really need to ask yourself WHY!! What does my skin
  want to tell me here? The skin is our biggest organ and holds 20% of our
  natural bacteria in it and on it, this bacteria gets fed by the other 80% of
  our bacteria in our gut. The skin is the window to our inner health and is
  also an organ that releases a lot of our toxins. So if there is something
  wrong with your skin, ask yourself - what could be the tigger??</p><p>Do I
  have too much physical or mental stress right now, how good is my sleep, am I
  drinking enough, do I drink alcohol or smoke, what do I eat?? These are the
  questions we need to ask ourselves. I know life sometimes isn't fair and there
  are girls out there who have great skin while eating whatever they want. But
  that does not mean they are healthy. They might even be still taking the birth
  control pill which helps with your skin but causes a lot of harm to your
  body.</p>

      that can have a really damaging effect on your skin.

      <h3>How I healed my skin after coming off the pill</h3><p>The first thing
      I would suggest if you&rsquo;re wanting to come off the pill or if
      you&rsquo;re already trying, is to go and get a complete blood test. The
      results will let you know if you are deficient in any nutrients or if you
      have other conditions that need to be taken care of that might affect or
      be affecting your skin.</p><p>After a couple months of being off the pill
      I also recommend you get a hormone test to gauge how your hormones are
      balancing out.</p><p>Now if you&rsquo;re anything like me I know
      you&rsquo;re serious about taking back control of your hormones and just
      overall becoming more in tune with your true self. So I'm going to jump
      right into the most effective solution that I found to heal my skin and
      rebalance my internal system. It is not an easy solution and it takes
      willpower to stick to it but it will change everything if you
      can.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3 id="the-veganpescatarian-candida-diet"><strong>The vegan/pescatarian
      candida diet&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>I got on this diet to try and heal my
      all my fungus diseases (my <strong><a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nutriplanet.org/2018/08/candida-overgrowth-guide/">candida</a>,&nbsp;</strong>the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>acne
      on my face &amp; white spots on my back called <strong><a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.healthline.com/health/tinea-versicolor">tinea
      versicolour</a></strong>). The white spots Ive lived with for almost 15
      years. This diet healed all my skin conditions when I was 100% strict with
      it. No more acne or pimples anywhere. However when I do not take 100% care
      of myself (bad diet, stress, sweaty clothes, bad sleep) my skin tells me
      right away. I have it much better under control but it is fair to say: In
      order to have amazing skin you have to work on yourself. It is an ongoing
      process.</p><p>From the results I got from being on this diet, I learnt
      that the health of my skin has a direct correlation to the health of my
      gut environment. Overtime from taking too many anti-inflammatories,
      drinking alcohol and eating processed/sugary and fried foods, I developed
      an unhealthy gut environment. An unhealthy gut is the perfect breeding
      ground for bacteria and fungus that can have a really damaging effect on
      your skin. Before you can take back control of your skin you need to
      create a healthy gut environment and I believe the best and most effective
      way to do this is to go on a strict vegan/pescatarian candida diet. I am
      going to link a great article about what this diet includes and some
      recipes for you <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.thecandidadiet.com/candida-diet-vegan-vegetarian/"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a>!</p><p>Essentially
      a <strong><a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nutriplanet.org">vegan/pescatarian candida
      diet</a></strong> is a diet that restricts all processed food and all
      refined sugars/carbs. I was shocked that I wasn't allowed to eat fruit,
      even the sugar in fruit was feeding the bad bacteria in my gut. I was also
      shocked that after 2 years of being vegan and eating predominantly whole
      foods, my gut wasn't healthy already. The problem is sugar! Once you have
      bad bacteria in your gut it can survive for years even on a really healthy
      diet. All the bad bacteria needs is some white bread or a bit of pasta or
      pizza or some coconut ice cream and it will stay with you.</p><p>I wish I
      could say that you can have a cheat meal here and there, or eating a
      sugary dessert once a week is ok. But what I found was that as soon as I
      made one mistake and ate something I shouldn't have, my skin would flair
      up right away and I would need to start again from the
      beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>I am so confident that if you can stick to a full
      vegan/pescatarian candida diet for 1 month you will experience amazing
      results and your skin will be so much healthier than before. It was hard
      for me especially when Jake was having food I couldn't eat but it was so
      worth it in the long run. The good news is that after a few months now I
      have been able to re-introduce some foods that are not in the diet like
      bread/pizza and my skin won't flare up like it used to.</p><p>This is
      something that worked really well for me, it may not be the same for all
      of you but its worth a try. There is no downside to eating a really clean
      diet, only benefits. The hard part is having the willpower to stay strong
      when you're tempted to eat naughty food.</p><p>This solution might not be
      for you, in that case there are several other things that really helped
      me. I will list them below.&nbsp;</p>

      I can’t stress enough how important it is to nourish your body with food
      that comes from the earth that isn't full of chemicals and processed sugar
    body-content_html: >-
      <h3>What other solutions helped me on my journey to getting off the pill
      and fixing my skin?</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A good wholesome
      plant-based diet</strong></p><p>This won&rsquo;t come as a surprise. I
      can&rsquo;t stress enough how important it is to nourish your body with
      food that comes from the earth that isn't full of chemicals and processed
      sugar.</p><p>Even if you are not vegan or vegetarian, try to avoid
      processed food and refined sugars. This will make a huge
      difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Try to include in your diet more seeds, nuts,
      legumes and fresh veggies.</p><h4><strong>No sugar</strong></h4><p>Refined
      sugar is our number one enemy when it comes to health. Besides leading to
      heart diseases, increasing the risk of Type 2 diabetes, accelerating
      aging, etc. it also causes skin breakouts and acne.&nbsp;</p><p>Avoiding
      sugar has been one of the most challenging parts of this journey. Every
      time I was craving it I had to remind myself about the reason I was doing
      all this. In the end, it is just not worth it.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Drink
      a lot of water</strong></h4><p>Staying hydrated is extremely important for
      our bodies. This is what gives us life.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t drink
      enough water during the day, the skin is the first organ to suffer from
      it.&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure to drink at least 2 liters per day. And remember
      that when you feel thirsty you are already dehydrated and you are late. I
      carry a reusable bottle of water everywhere I go and I always keep it on
      the desk when I am working.</p><h4><strong>Apple cider
      vinegar</strong></h4><p>Apple cider vinegar was used as a natural remedy
      for health problems for a very long period of time. I incorporated it into
      my daily routine about a year ago. I mix it with water and drink it on an
      empty stomach every morning.&nbsp;</p><p>This has helped to not only clear
      out my skin but also improved my digestion and reduced
      bloating.</p><p>This is <a target="_blank"
      href="https://amzn.to/2yMhdZ4"><u>the one</u></a> I&rsquo;ve been
      using.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Probiotics</strong></h4><p>I can&rsquo;t
      stress enough how important your gut health is. If you have an imbalance
      in your gut, it prevents your body from absorbing and using the nutrients
      from your food, it also makes it difficult for your body to fight off
      viruses and infection. Probiotics will keep your&nbsp; gut healthy so you
      never need to worry about this. Probiotics will also reduce inflammation
      and help to get rid of the toxins which will have a beneficial effect on
      your skin.&nbsp;</p><p>You can either choose to buy them in capsules or
      you can include the following products in your diet: tempeh, kefir,
      yogurt, pickled veggies, miso, kimchi.</p><h4><strong>Less
      stress</strong></h4><p>It is no secret that stress is not good for us.
      Stress hormones affect all your hormones in general and this can cause
      breakouts.</p><p>Find the things that&nbsp; bring stress and anxiety into
      your life and see what changes you can make to minimise and eventually
      fully remove them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Sun and
      saltwater</strong></h4><p>I feel like it can be very personal, as
      I&rsquo;ve heard people say that saltwater dries out their skin. However,
      I feel that it has had a positive impact on my skin. Have you ever taken a
      dip in the ocean and noticed how quickly any cuts and scratches heal
      after? The ocean is full of bacteria that can help us heal. It will have
      the same effect on your face skin, especially if you picked any of the
      pimples.&nbsp;</p><p>The sun helps our body to produce vitamin D and
      serotonin, which is associated with lifting up our mood, relaxation and
      stress decrease.</p><p>But remember that everything is good in
      moderation.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Good sleep</strong></h4><p>I feel like
      this goes together with having less stress in your life. Sleep is the time
      when your body and mind rest and recover. A healthy amount of sleep is
      considered 8 hours per night. I know it is not always possible but it is
      all about balance. If one night you sleep less than you catch up the next
      night.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a good night of sleep by itself won&rsquo;t cure
      your acne but in combination with other things from this list, it can do
      wonders.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-cms-popout-id="image-1"

      src="https://app.cloudcannon.com/sites/80006/site_files/raw/?path=images/style/sleep-maja.jpg&amp;timestamp=1589424614775"
      /></p><h4><strong>No touching of the face</strong></h4><p>Most of the time
      we are doing this without even noticing. But imagine all the bacteria you
      are transferring from your hands onto your already inflamed skin. This is
      not good for your skin, try to avoid it as much as
      possible.</p><h4><strong>Use a clean towel</strong></h4><p>The same goes
      for using a clean face towel. Try to change it at least every 3 days but
      preferably every day. I suggest buying a set of small towels that will be
      used for face only, not even for your hands.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong><a
      target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WOBkxL"><u>Tea tree
      oil</u></a></strong></h4><p>This oil has a great anti-inflammatory effect.
      When I feel that I am about to get a pimple, I apply tea tree oil on that
      spot and it reduces the redness and sometimes the pimple won&rsquo;t even
      come out. I also find that it helps to prevent and reduce scarring and
      leave my skin smooth and soft.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong><a target="_blank"
      href="https://amzn.to/3fHFEI0"><u>Pure aloe
      vera</u></a></strong></h4><p>This is another great natural solution for
      scaring. I like applying it overnight. I only do it on the area where I
      have breakouts and I find that in the morning my skin looks much less
      inflamed.</p><p><img data-cms-popout-id="image-0"
      data-cms-original-src="/images/style/aloe-vera-maja.jpg" width="1600"
      height="2000"

      /></p><h4><strong>Celery juice</strong></h4><p>Celery juice has a huge
      detoxifying and strengthening effect on our bodies. And naturally having
      less toxins in your body will have a positive effect on your skin. Celery
      juice is also high in sodium which raises stomach acids and it helps us to
      digest and to break down food fast. As a result, this leads to a healthy
      gut which we all know now has direct connection to the quality of our
      skin.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong><a target="_blank"
      href="https://amzn.to/3cq7RRp"><u>Hemp seed
      oil</u></a></strong></h4><p>Why hemp seed oil? Because it helps to
      moisturize our skin without clogging it and it is suitable for most skin
      types. Dryness can cause your skin to overproduce oil and this leads to
      more breakouts.</p>

      <h3 id="what-is-advised-by-professionals">What is advised by
      professionals:</h3><p>If you've tried coming off the pill and had
      struggles with your skin/rebalancing your hormones, you will know how
      difficult it is to find the answers you're looking for. Its especially
      hard because you want results to come NOW! I've found that there is no
      quick fix and the professionals in the field tend to say the same. Apart
      from the above things I've mentioned what else do the professionals
      say?</p><p><strong>Get your mineral levels tested:</strong> zinc, selenim,
      Vitamin D3, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Omega 3, Q10. In case you have
      deficiency consider supplementing certain essential minerals and
      vitamins.</p><p><strong>Take care of your liver -&nbsp;</strong>It is
      responsible for getting toxins out of our bodies. I&rsquo;ve already
      mentioned this a few times in the post, but only because it is this
      important. Fewer toxins = better skin.</p><p>Try to include in your diet
      more foods that have bitter substances in them (such as artichokes, sage
      and Brussel sprouts)</p><p>Also try to keep alcohol to a
      minimum.</p><p><strong>Good skincare</strong> - start paying more
      attention to the ingredients list of your skincare. General rule - if you
      can&rsquo;t pronounce it, it&rsquo;s not good for you. Try to avoid
      silicon, parabens, and alcohol as much as possible. Search for more
      natural ingredients, such as mentioned before - aloe vera, good oils
      (coconut, hemp, tea tree, argan, essential oils, etc), avocado, apple
      cider vinegar, etc.&nbsp;</p>

I get so many questions from girls about how did I grow my online confidence and stopped being afraid of the camera, that I decided to dedicate the whole post to this topic.&nbsp;

Especially at the beginning, it wasn’t easy so I can totally imagine how you feel. We all have insecurities about ourselves and we are afraid of being judged for them. The Internet is a cool and fun place to be but it can also be hurtful sometimes. You have to grow some skin in order to withstand some of the opinions people share online. On the other hand, we’ve been blessed to have the kindest, most genuine, and warm-hearted online community. You guys are the best and we can’t put into words how grateful we are for every single one of you.&nbsp;

I will share with you all the things I did that helped me build my online confidence.&nbsp;

* ### The power of visualization&nbsp;

We all know, that what we think we become. If you imagine yourself being a confident person, your mind will believe it and soon enough you will also start acting this way. Just close your eyes and imagine yourself confidently walking down the street and being proud of who you are. Give yourself a compliment every time you look in the mirror. I like to leave a little post-it on our bathroom mirror with a positive affirmation. So every time I or Jake walk in there it serves as a little reminder for some self-love.&nbsp;

Little things like that will help you create a new vision of yourself. You will see yourself as a self-assured, positive, and beautiful human being, who is ready to conquer the world.

* ### Journal and write down what you like about yourself

I and Jake try to journal 5-10 minutes every morning. We use this time to write down our thoughts, things we are grateful for, and things we want to achieve.

It is one thing to have thoughts in your head and totally different when you write them down on a piece of paper. Suddenly, they become so much more real. I suggest you dedicate some time to sitting down and list everything you like about yourself. Don’t be shy and write down everything that comes to mind. From the way you look to the things you do or say. It can be anything\! Write it down\!

Trust me, once you see all those things in front of you, you can’t help but feel good about yourself.&nbsp;

* ### Ask close ones what they like about you the most

I know a lot of people find it difficult to accept compliments but this is something different. Ask this question to the people who are the closest to you and whose opinion you value. Ask them to name things about you that they think make you a great human being. Why do they love you and what qualities do they like the most in you.

Hearing those things from people you care will for sure help to boost your confidence.

* ### Practice being in front of the camera

It is true that practice makes perfect. In order to get used to being on camera, you have to actually start being on camera. Start with taking pictures and recording videos of yourself as if you were going to post them online. The more you’ll do it the more confident you’ll become. Watch back all the videos and photos you took and see which ones you like the most. See how you looked on them, what pose you like the most, and try to repeat it the next time you start shooting again.&nbsp;

After you took hundreds of photos and recorder hours of videos, you will get so used to being on camera that you won’t even notice it.

* ### Be okay with not being perfect (people like honesty)

We are all humans and nobody is perfect, and it is the beauty of this world. You don’t have to reshoot the whole video because you forgot that one word or didn’t notice a piece of hair sticking out. All this makes you real.&nbsp;

If you messed up, laugh about it and people will laugh with you. If your eyes are half-closed but the photo represents your true emotions, post it anyway. All those little “imperfections” will bring you closer to your audience, trust me.

* ### Accept that you will start as a beginner and know that practice makes you a pro

It kinda goes along with the previous point but I wanted to put it separately so that I can stress out one thing. Please don’t put the pressure on yourself to get it perfectly right from the beginning. Don’t try to control your every move and every word. It is very obvious to your viewers and it will only make it worst. Try to relax as much as possible and let everything come naturally. Experience comes with time and you will get there if you keep trying.

* ### If you’re a perfectionist: plan your content in advance

If for example, you want to post more on Instagram Story but the fact that your video is not perfect stops you from posting it, then change it. Record it as many times as you need to be happy with it.

Plan your content in advance, search for locations, pick your outfits, and write down what you want to say. If being as prepared as possible takes the stress away then do it.&nbsp;

When we go to a new location, we like to do research in advance and have a few ideas in mind. This saves us a lot of time and removes unnecessary worries.&nbsp;

All those things have helped me and I am sure they can help you as well. Remember that you are beautiful the way you are. You don’t have to pretend and try to be somebody else. There is an audience for everyone and you will find your niche once you get out there. Don’t be afraid to be yourself, stay positive and practice, practice, practice.
