If you are feeling more artsy you can try yourself in web design. Instead of building a website, you will be responsible for the aesthetic portion of the creating process.

Coursera and Udemy have great courses for Web Design as well.

**Graphic designer**

If designing websites doesn’t sound that appealing, but creating visual content does, then graphic design might be for you. You need to have a good feel for fonts, a sense of colors, and shapes and be able to create a visual story.&nbsp;

You will be designing logos, posters, brochures, billboards, etc. You can choose to go freelance or apply to a magazine, advertising or marketing agency.

This could include responding to comments and direct messages, scheduling, and uploading posts, reaching out to brands and influencers, etc. Most probably you already know how to do most of these tasks, so why not give it a try?

**Content creator**

One more popular job that can help you earn money from anywhere in the world is creating content for companies. This could be anything from producing digital content, such as photos and videos, to offline content - writing copies, blog posts, e-books, etc.&nbsp;

A lot of companies choose to outsource those tasks to freelance content creators and this could be your chance to make an extra income.&nbsp;

TIP - great platforms to submit your articles are Medium and Goop.

**Copywriter&nbsp;**

Not to be confused with offline content creation. The main goal of a copywriter is to create a text that can convince readers to take action. Whether it is buying, downloading or engaging.

Everybody can write. It is a skill that can be learned the same as learning to play a guitar or to dance salsa. There are plenty of online copywriting courses to help you master writing technics. And you can start earning money online within no time.&nbsp;

You might already have some online following or if not, it is never too late to start building it. A common misconception is that you need to have hundreds of thousands of followers to start earning money from your social media platforms.&nbsp;

It is proven that micro-bloggers have a much more engaged audience than bloggers-millionaires. For this reason, a lot of companies choose to include smaller bloggers in their marketing campaigns. You might not earn a full-time income straight away but it for sure can bring some extra money. So stop waiting and start monetizing your blog now.&nbsp;

**VA or Virtual Assistant**

If you like organizing and doing administrative tasks than you might want to try yourself in a VA role. What it basically means is that you will be somebody’s executive assistant remotely.
