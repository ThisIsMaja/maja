Due to the job we do, I and Jake usually don’t have the possibility to cook our own meals. Most of the time we are on the road and we just grab something quick at a local shop or cafe. It has changed a little bit when we got our apartment in Kuala Lumpur. We have a beautiful small kitchen there and we finally could start cooking our own food.&nbsp;

We have been staying at a villa in Bali for the past two months, where we have a beautiful outdoor kitchen. And especially now, during quarantine, when most of the shops and cafes are closed, we have been spending a lot of time experimenting with new recipes.&nbsp;

If you want to know more about our diet, we have written a separate blog post dedicated to that.&nbsp;

In this post, we decided to share with you some of our favorite vegan recipes. They are super easy to make yet so delicious.&nbsp;

### One-pot Dal Curry

This one is without a doubt the one we make the most. It is warm and hearty and it provides a ton of good nutrients to your body.&nbsp;

#### What you will need

Coconut oil or any other oil

1 cup dry lentils - we use red lentils but you can also use green or yellow

Vegetables of your choice:

* Onion or shallots finely diced
* Garlic finely chopped
* Fresh ginger minced
* Chili, if you like it spicy
* Optional: carrot, bell pepper, can diced tomatoes

2,5 - 3 cups of water or vegetable broth&nbsp;

1 cup coconut milk

1-2 tbsp fresh lemon juice

Spices

Those are the ones we like to use, but you can totally change them based on your taste.

* 1 tbsp curry powder
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp turmeric
* 1 tsp paprika
* ¼ tsp cinnamon&nbsp;
* Salt & pepper

#### Instructions

* We recommend to always rinse lentils before cooking them. This will help to remove any hidden stones and wash the substance that can cause indigestion.
* Prepare a big pot and heat coconut oil in it. Once hot add your vegetable. Saute them for 3-5 minutes on low-medium heat.&nbsp;
* Add your spices and mix well. It has to form a paste.&nbsp;
* Add water (or vegetable broth) and lentil and bring them to boil. Simmer for about 10 minutes.&nbsp;
* To finish off add coconut milk and simmer for another 5-7 minutes until desired thickness.&nbsp;
* Season with salt, pepper, and fresh lemon juice.

We like to eat it together with brown rice. But feel free to serve it with any type of grain.&nbsp;

En voila. Enjoy\!

### Cilli sin Carne

This is a Mexican inspired hearty dinner dish. The process of cooking is similar to dahl curry, only the ingredients are slightly different.&nbsp;

#### Ingredients

* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 3 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 large red onion, thinly sliced
* 2 celery stalks, finely chopped
* 2 medium carrots, peeled and finely chopped
* 2 red peppers, roughly chopped
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp chili powder
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 800 g tinned chopped tomatoes
* 400 g tin of red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
* 100 g split red lentils
* 250 ml vegetable stock

We don’t really like to use meat replacements but if you like you can add 400 grm of soy mince.&nbsp;

It is a one-pot dish, so you basically just throw everything in.&nbsp;

Heat the olive oil and add all the veggies then mix in the spices. Pour in the chopped tomatoes, kidney beans, lentils, soy mince, and vegetable stock. Simmer for about 20 minutes. Serve with rice or any other grain.&nbsp;

We like to make a lot of it so we can also have some of it for lunch the next day. It is a great dish to prep in advance and keep it in the freezer, for the days you don’t feel like cooking.&nbsp;

### Vietnamese summer rolls

This is a great vegan dish for warmer weather. It is super hot in Bali now, so we’ve been making it a lot.&nbsp;

You can be as creative as you want with the filling. Make them sweet or spicy, use only vegetables or add tofu. Basically check what you have in the fridge and throw it in there.&nbsp;

The only part where you might need a little bit of practice is rolling your ingredients in a rice paper. But we have no doubt you can manage it.&nbsp;

#### Here is what we like to add in them:

* Vegetables - chopped carrot, bell pepper, cucumber, avocado, and cabbage.
* Tofu - first we like to marinate it in vegetable broth, tamari, coconut sugar, and Chinese five-spice for about 30 minutes. And then fry it in the pan for about 10 minutes.&nbsp;
* Fresh herbs - mint, basil, coriander, parsley, etc..
* Fruits - peaches and mangos.
* As an option, you can also add Chinese rice noodles.&nbsp;

The secret of taking your rice paper rolls to the next level is peanut butter sauce. It is an absolute must and is quick and easy to make. You can make a batch and keep it in the fridge.

#### Here are the ingredients for peanut butter sauce:

* 2 heaped tbsp of pure peanut butter
* Juice from 1 lime
* 4-6 tbsp water
* 1 tbsp of soy sauce or tamari
* 1 garlic clove grated
* 1 tbsp grated ginger
* Chili flakes is you like spicy

So yummy\!

### Vegan dumplings

This recipe can be as easy or as time-consuming as you want to make it. But trust us, in any case, it is so worth it.

There are two parts to the process of preparing dumplings:

First - preparing dumpling wrappers. You can choose to make them from scratch. That’s where it can get quite time-consuming. Or you can buy them ready in the store. That’s what we usually do.&nbsp;

Second - preparing the filling. Once again, here you can be as creative as you want. Choose ingredients based on your taste.&nbsp;

#### What we like to add in our dumplings

* Tofu - we use the same tofu we make for our summer rolls. So you make prep a lot of it and use it in both recipes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
* 1 small head cauliflower
* 1 cup green onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1½ cups fresh shitake mushrooms, or any other mushrooms you can find
* 1 tbsp oil, we like to use sesame oil
* 2 tbsp soy sauce or tamari
* 2 tsp minced ginger
* 2 tsp miso paste, white or yellow

Sauce

Use the same peanut butter sauce from the Vietnamese summer rolls recipe.&nbsp;

#### Instructions

* Heat the oil in the pan and add broken cauliflower pieces. Saute for about 3-5 minutes and add the rest of the vegetables, tofu, and miso.&nbsp;

If your tofu is not prepped in advance then chop it in cubes and add together with the cauliflower.

* Pour soy sauce in and cook for about 10 minutes or until all the water from the mushrooms is evaporated.&nbsp;
* Remove from the heat and let it cool off.&nbsp;
* Transfer the veggie mix into a food processor or a blender. Pulse it a few times. You want it to be smooth but don’t turn into a paste.
* Follow the instructions on your store-bought dumpling wrappers to fill them with the mixture you just made. When you seal the wrappers make sure to remove all the air from therm.&nbsp;
* Pan fry your dumplings for about 2-3 minutes on a low-medium heat.&nbsp;
* Serve with the peanut butter sauce.&nbsp;

### Homemade sauerkraut - How we make it

Sauerkraut contains many nutrients important for our health. It is particularly nutritious because it undergoes fermentation, which helps grow probiotics. And they help to absorb all the minerals and vitamins in our bodies.&nbsp;

I feel like it has also helped my skin cleared out, in combination with a balanced diet in general.

#### Ingredients

* White or red cabbage
* Salt
* Minced garlic & ginger

#### Instructions

* Cut the cabbage in thin slices and put it in a bowl.
* Add salt and massage it in until cabbage is soft and juicy.
* Grate garlic and ginger into the bowl and mix it all up.
* Put the cabbage mixture in a jar and make sure the juice fills the whole jar. Alternatively, put a cabbage leaf on top of the soon to be sauerkraut, so it doesn’t get any air.
* Wait 5-10 days depending on where you are. In a hot climate, it takes 5 days. If you have it in a dark room where it isn’t too cold or too hot it will work well. The best temperature to ferment is 18-23 degrees Celcius.

### Oven-dried tomatoes

Another thing we like to make and add to our salads lates is oven-dried tomatoes. It is quick and easy to make but it adds a ton of flavor to your food.&nbsp;

#### All you need are:

* Tomatoes obviously :)&nbsp;
* Salt
* Olive oils

It is pretty self-explanatory how to make them. So here are a few tips on how to make them extra nice:

* Make sure tomatoes are dry after you washed them
* Slice tomatoes lengthwise
* Remove the pulp as much as possible&nbsp;
* In the oven arrange the rack on the lowest part of the oven and the temperature to 90 degrees.&nbsp;
* Make sure tomatoes don’t touch each other
* Dehydrate them for 4-6 hours

We love adding them to sandwiches and salads. We usually make a big butch of them, so we have them ready when we feel like snacking.&nbsp;

So here are some of our favorite vegan recipes that we like to make. They are quick and easy yet delicious and nutritious.&nbsp;

Let us know if you try to make any of them.
