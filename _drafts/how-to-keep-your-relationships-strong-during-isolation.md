We all remember the times when we could go out for dinner to a restaurant, see a movie in the cinema, go clubbing or attend a concert together. Unfortunately with the current situation in the world, those things are not an option at the moment and we don’t know when we will be able to do them again. Hopefully soon, but for now life goes on and we need to enjoy it none the less.&nbsp;

We all have been stuck at home for a few months now. Some of us have been fortunate enough to share this time with their partner or family. And some of us are forced to go into a long-distance relationship or haven’t been able to see family due to lock-down.&nbsp;

In this post, we want to share with you a few tips on how to keep your relationships strong and healthy while living and working together 24/7.&nbsp;

Let us know if you would also like us to write a blog post focusing on long-distance relationships and we will totally do it.&nbsp;

1. Create quality time

We can’t stress enough how important this is. The fact that you are living together and see each other all day every day, doesn’t count as quality time.&nbsp;

Quality time is when you make time for each other and you do something together. Put your phones away and make sure both of you are fully present during this time. Give each other 100% of your undivided attention. Show your loved one how much you care and love them.&nbsp;

You can be as creative as you want when coming up with ideas of what to do. But if you are struggling with it we have thought of a few cool things you can do:

* Don’t be afraid to be kids again. Build a fort, make it all cozy with lots of blankets and pillows. Dim the lights or decorate it with fairy lights, if you have them. Order in, get your favorite snacks, and have a movie night.&nbsp;

* Imitate a night out in a bar. Put on nice clothes, maybe even heels if you are feeling fancy. Put your party playlist on loud and have a cocktail evening with some delicious snacks.

* Cook a delicious dinner together, while singing along to your favorite songs. Lights some candles and enjoy a meaningful conversation together.&nbsp;

* Create a schedule together

Ask each other questions “What do we want to achieve over this time? What are the habits we want to make over the next few weeks? What goals do we want to reach by the time this is all over?”

Make a plan for both of you and work on completing it together. This will help you grow and evolve together and as a result, it will bring you so much closer.&nbsp;

* Play board games or make a puzzle.

A Monopoly is a great game to play with two people and the time will fly by you won’t even notice. If you are not a fan of Monopoly do a quick Google search and you will find a ton of different games to choose from.&nbsp;

During the day encourage each other with phrases like “I can’t wait for our date tonight. What time are you picking me up?”. It will add a bit of flirt into it. You can even go as far as one of you leaving the apartment and ringing the doorbell as if he or she is actually picking you up.

The possibilities are endless. Just think of an activity both of you enjoy and see how you can adapt it to your house environment.&nbsp;

1. Create space

Spending time apart is as important as spending it together. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a long period of time. For most people, 30-90 minutes can be more than enough.&nbsp;

We are all individuals with our own needs. In normal daily life before the global pandemic, couples spend time apart (besides being at work) all the time without even noticing. It can be as simple is quickly running out to go to a grocery store or a post office, going shopping with your bestie, or having a drink outside with mates.&nbsp;

This time can be used to read a book in a separate room, listen to a podcast, give yourself some self-love and have a pamper night, play video games, FaceTime with a friend, etc.&nbsp;

Time alone gives you an opportunity to process your thought, pursue hobbies and it brings freshness into relationships.&nbsp;

Don’t be afraid to ask for some time alone. Partners in every healthy relationship need it.&nbsp;
