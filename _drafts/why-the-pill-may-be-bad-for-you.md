  How has Bali fared compared to the rest of the world? Has this peaceful island
  turned into chaos?
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>Two and a half months ago at the start of the global pandemic we had a
  really hard decision to make, where do we go? For most people the answer is
  simple, 'home'. But for us it's kind of complicated. We've been travelling the
  world non stop for 4 years and although we have an apartment in Kuala Lumpur,
  home for us is still to be decided.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the seriousness of
  the situation we were forced to ask ourselves the question "where do we feel
  the most at home?&rdquo; and the answer was clear - Bali.&nbsp;</p><p>We have
  been here for 3 months now and we couldn&rsquo;t be happier about our
  decision. Although there have been a lot of changes on the island, we love
  this place and we love how the locals and foreigners combined have handled the
  difficult situation we all find ourselves in.</p><p>How has Bali faired
  compared to the rest of the world? Has this peaceful island turned into chaos?
  We know that a lot of you had to cancel your travel plans to come here and are
  probably wondering when you might be able to return.</p><p>So in this post, we
  want to share our observations with you of how life here in Bali has changed
  and give you information direct from the authorities.</p>

      <h4><strong>How has Bali been affected?</strong></h4><p>Bali locals are
      being hit much harder than other places by this lockdown because of their
      reliance on the tourism industry. As you can imagine there are barely any
      tourists here. Those who are here are either locals or foreigners who
      permanently live in Bali. We don't know when Bali will be open for tourism
      again. One thing is clear, the longer borders stay closed the more
      difficult it will be for the island to recover.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone that
      has visited Bali will know how kind and generous the local people are.
      Even during a time of crisis we still have to force our delivery drivers,
      our cleaning ladies or servers at cafes just to take a $2 or $3
      tip.&nbsp;</p><p>If you follow us on Instagram you will know about our
      DOGOOD Monday&rsquo;s. If not, this is something we have been doing for
      over a year now. Basically, every Monday we try to do something good for
      someone else. In the past few weeks, we&rsquo;ve been sharing different
      programs, names of the foundations and ways you can help to support the
      local Balinese people. Even the smallest contribution can make a huge
      difference to a local family or business.&nbsp;</p><p>If you love Bali and
      want to help the island recover, we will list below a few ways you can
      help.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="how-can-you-help"><strong>How can you

      <p>The past few months haven&rsquo;t been easy and they have brought and
      will continue bringing a lot of changes around the world. We know that a
      lot of people have been feeling a lot of mixed emotions during this time -
      stress, anxiety, fear of uncertainty, helplessness, and loneliness. We
      have always found that giving to others and providing a helping hand is

**Why the pill may be bad for you**

Recently I wrote a blog post about [how](__notset__)[I healed my skin after coming off the pill](https://thisismaja.com/posts/healing-skin-after-coming-off-the-pill). The process of coming off the pill was so challenging and so stressful, you are probably wondering why I put myself through that? There are many reasons why and I want to share those reasons with you in this blog post. I also want to tell you about what alternatives there are and what is working for me.

So how did I end up going down the path of first questioning the pill and then decided to get off it completely. 4 years ago I started a journey towards a more holistic, conscious and healthy lifestyle. I started focusing on eating whole plant-based food, exercising, meditating and in general reconnecting with my natural self. This sort of 'awakening' has honestly changed my life in so many ways. Im happier, I'm more successful, I feel so much healthier, Im filled with love most days.

About 18 months ago I found myself in a conundrum that a lot of girls also find themselves in. While everyday I was doing all the right things like eating healthy, exercising and practising mindfulness I was also taking a synthetic pill that went against everything I was trying to achieve.

How could I continue living such a natural lifestyle while taking a pill that is full of synthetic hormones and is everything but natural? And whats more, I asked myself 'how unfair and evil is it that we females are told to get on the pill at a young age. And then when we want to get off because we are wise enough to make informed decisions, we cant because the effects of coming off are so bad that most of us would prefer to just put up with it'. I was committed to breaking free of this cycle and I really want to help you if you're ready for it.

&nbsp;

***Why the pill is not natural***

Your body has its own sets of cycles, circadian rhythms and internal body clocks that produces hormones when we need them, and keeps our basic homeostatic processes running smoothly. A woman’s menstrual cycle regulates fertility and has an impact on her mood, bone health, skin health and even mental clarity. The intricate balance between shifting oestrogen and progesterone levels is what drives this. The pill manipulates our natural cycle by pushing these hormones into an unnatural flat curve, effectively stopping ovulation from occurring, and then inducing a ‘fake period’ by letting hormone levels drop suddenly (placebo pills).

For some women who struggle with terribly painful or heavy periods, unbalanced hormones, or conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome, the pill can be a lifesaver. But for all of us out there who don't have any issues, the pill actually does more harm than good. Our bodies have evolved over thousands of years constantly changing and adapting to our environment. We are perfect just the way we are and when we try to interfere with something so complex like the human body made up of trillions on cells all communicating and working together, things are bound to go wrong.&nbsp;

***Common 'side' effects of the pill and warnings***

I really don't like the term 'side effects'. It means that certain negative effects from a drug or the pill for example are unintended. But those effects are not 'side' effects, they are just 'effects'. The drugs cause those things and there is no other way to put it. When it comes to the pill these 'effects' are especially bad, one of them being when you get on you can't get back off without withdrawals and skin flare ups.

Some of the most common side effects women on combined oral contraceptives complain about:

* Affects mood and behaviour
* Increases depression and anxiety
* Causes a change in libido
* Causes weight gain and increased appetite
* Oestrogen-induced migraines
* Irregular bleeding
* Breast tenderness

The pill can also increase the risk of developing breast cancer later in life and the development of blood clots and stroke.&nbsp;

Most manufacturers advise that women older than 35, smokers, and women with a history or family history of high blood pressure, stroke, blood clots, breast or uterine cancer, migraine with aura or diabetes should not use the pill because of an increased risk of side effects. Also, the pill does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases.

***Natural contraception choices to consider***

Contraception is extremely important when we want to avoid unplanned pregnancy, and the pill has a 99% success rate. But there has always been some controversy surrounding the pill and it’s a perfect case of the benefits outweighing the risks. I decided that the benefits of taking the pill did not outweigh the risk, my body is my temple. There is a great quote that reads 'every time you put something in your body it either ***feeds&nbsp;***or&nbsp;***fights&nbsp;***disease. I want you to think about what category the pill would fall into if you had to take a guess.

But then the big question comes 'what contraceptive can take its place?'. I am so grateful that Jake has been supportive in my decision and even the driving force. We both want to be healthy, happy and in control of our own hormones. This has made it easier for me to choose the right thing over the easy thing. If we have intercourse we use condoms. It is not the perfect solution and we wish there would be something else but for now until there is a better option, its better than interfering with my internal system and potentially regretting it later on.

Other contraceptive measures like the IUD or implant also contain hormones so therefore I want to avoid. Natural contraception takes a lot of discipline and will take some planning from your side, but it’s worth it if you don’t have to deal with the hormonal side effects anymore.

Here is a full list of potential natural solutions for you, remember that no contraceptive method is 100% effective and if you want to avoid being pregnant entirely the only option is to abstain completely from intercourse.&nbsp;

* Condoms – male and female condoms are probably the most cost-effective and convenient choice
* Copper-T – implanted into the uterus and creates an infertile environment&nbsp;
* Cycle tracking – tracking the days when you are the most fertile (12-day window) and avoiding intercourse during that time. [Cycle-tracking apps are great for this](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/flo-period-pregnancy-tracker/id1038369065?l=en).
* Basal temperature tracking – similar to cycle tracking, you determine how close you are to ovulation by measuring your temperature. Can also be logged on an app for convenience
* Spermicides – used before intercourse to kill sperm. Should ideally be used with a barrier method for increased effectivity
* Other barrier methods – these can be a bit of a hassle to use but should be effective in most cases. This includes a diaphragm, cervical sponge, cervical cap
* ‘Pull-out’ method – stopping intercourse before ejaculation&nbsp;

&nbsp;

To wrap it all up I just want to share my love and empathy with you. It is such a difficult and heavy responsibility that us women have to carry on our shoulders. Think about your priorities and try to align your contraceptive choice with those proirities. For me, my health and mental clarity is my top priority so I choose a natural contraceptive. For you, your top priority might be to have fun and not worry about the consequences of potentially becoming pregnant, so the pill makes sense. That is ok as well. If your priorities later change then you can switch\!

Just remember that switching off the pill is very difficult and the longer you are on it, the harder it gets to come off. This&nbsp;
