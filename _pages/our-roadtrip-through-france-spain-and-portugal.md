We had the idea to pick up a camper and do a road trip down to Portugal to meet our friends Raquel and Miguel (@explorerssaurus\_). We've never been to Portugal before and we already have our eye on the perfect Camper Van for the trip. But then we started to wonder, can we actually travel through France, Spain and then Portugal right now taking into account the COVID restrictions. So we started to do some research and this is what we found out.

When traveling from Germany to France:

\- they warn people of unnecessary travels to Ile-de-France, Provence-Alpes-Cote-d’Azur, Auvergne-Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes, Occitanie, Nouvelle-Aquitaine and Corse because of high infection rates<br>\- No restrictions for entry and transit. When returning to Germany there’s a five day quarantine obligation which ends with the receiving of a negative Corona test (starting from 1st of October). If you only enter France for transit without overnight stay the quarantine might be omitted&nbsp;

When traveling from France to Spain:

\- no restrictions for travelers coming from France (neither for entry or transit)<br>\- There might be a health check where they check your temperature and entry formal<br>\- A lot of the camping grounds are open

Traveling from Spain to Portugal:

\- no restrictions for travelers coming from Spain&nbsp;<br>\- You might have to provide information about your destination, reason for the trip, contact details (when you entry by plane the airline will keep your entry information card and they will check your temperature)

General rules:

\- cafes, restaurants and bars have close between 8-11pm<br>\- maximum of four people per group to go to a restaurant, cafe, bar<br>\- No alcoholic beverages in public areas<br>\- minimum distance of 2m to other people&nbsp;<br>\- You have to wear a mask in stores and public transportation

It seems like our camper road trip to Portugal is a possibility with a potential 5 day quarantine when we arrive back in Germany. We have started making official plans and will pick up our camper in a week or so. Fingers crossed the restrictions don't change within this time, we will be keeping a close eye on what's going on.

We can't wait to show you guys what possibilities there are right now in terms of travel and show you how amazing road trips can be\! We know that we are all restricted right now but that doesn't mean we cant still have fun :)

If you have been camping around Europe lately we would love to hear how you've found the experience so far and if any of you guys have questions or information about anything related to this upcoming trip, we would love to chat in the comments below. As always, lots of love xx&nbsp;
