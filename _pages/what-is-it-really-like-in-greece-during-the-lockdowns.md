      <p class="big-emphasis">We arrived in Athens Greece on the 16th of August
      2020 in the middle of the global pandemic that has seen many countries
      close their borders and enforce lockdowns.&nbsp;</p><p>We've been
      following the news for the past 5 months and if we hadn't left our home we
      might have believed in all the doom and gloom. But now that we have left
      Bali and flown across the world to Greece, we can assure you that the
      world is still turning and things are more normal than you might
      expect.&nbsp;</p><p>While we absolutely recommend that we act responsibly
      and safe, we don't think that locking ourselves down and waiting for the
      corona virus to disappear is anything close to a solution. Without
      succumbing to fear a better solution would be to accept this virus might
      be around for a while and put into place measures to combat it while
      regaining our lives and the global economy.</p>
