      <p>We arrived in Athens Greece on the 16th of August 2020 in the middle of
      the global pandemic that has seen many countries close their borders and
      enforce lockdowns.&nbsp;</p><p>We've been following the news for the past
      5 months and if we hadn't left our home we might have believed in all the
      doom and gloom. But now that we have left Bali and flown across the world
      to Greece, we can assure you that the world is still turning and things
      are more normal than you might expect.&nbsp;</p><p>While we absolutely
      recommend that we act responsibly and safe, we don't think that locking
      ourselves down and waiting for the corona virus to disappear is anything
      close to a solution. Without succumbing to fear a better solution would be
      to accept this virus might be around for a while and put into place
      measures to combat it while regaining our lives and the global
      economy.</p>
