Today is the perfect starting point to make the first steps towards whatever it is you truly want\! But you need a plan ‚ú®You need to write down what you want and you need to decide what you will do everyday to get it üôèüèª

We created the Accountability Calendar to help you achieve your goals in 2020. Join us as we fill out our Calendar everyday, scoring ourselves a 1, 2 or 3 depending on how many daily goals we successfully achieved. We will be sharing our calendar on social media daily to keep ourselves even more accountable\!\!

At the end of the month we will add up all our points to see how successful our months really are\! With a little bit of friendly competition and daily tracking we know we can all achieve much much more this year\!&nbsp;
