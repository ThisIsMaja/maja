  This one is for the girls;  my period cramps have been so bad lately I figured
  it's time I put in the research!
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>Just under 2 years ago I decided to come off the pill (<a target="_blank"
  rel="noopener"
  href="https://thisismaja.com/posts/why-the-pill-may-be-bad">find out why
  here</a>). Up until this point I rarely ever had my period as my cycle was so
  out of wack. Coming off the pill has been one of the best decisions i've made
  for many reasons. However one thing I didn't have to deal when I was on the
  pill was damn period pain!!!</p><p>I have asked thousands of girls what works
  to reduce period pain for them and i've combined those answers with things
  that also work for me in this blog post. I always prefer natural remedies over
  chemical drugs as there are no side effects and they are more gentle on our
  beautiful bodies. I really hope this post helps you find a solution or a
  variety of solutions that can give you some relief.</p>

      <p><strong>Without further ado here are my top suggestions for period pain
      relief!</strong></p><h3 id="hot-water-bottle"><strong>Hot water
      bottle</strong></h3><p>I find that applying heat on my belly and back
      helps significantly with period cramps. You can buy one of those special
      warm bottles online. Or you can also make it yourself by putting uncooked
      rice into a sock and microwaving it for a few minutes. Make sure you
      don&rsquo;t overheat either of those. It should be slightly warmer than
      your own body temperature.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="herbs--spices"><strong>Herbs
      &amp; Spices</strong></h3><p>Together with applying some heat on your
      body, you can try to enjoy a cup of warm herbal tea. The easiest tea that
      I like to make is hot water with some lemon and ginger. I might also add
      mint if I have it.</p><p>There are also some specific herbs that are
      proven to have an anti-inflammatory effect on our bodies. These are
      chamomile, fennel seeds, cinnamon and dill. You can drink them on their
      own or create your own tea-mix.</p><p>A great spice with the same effect
      is turmeric. You can try adding it to your meals or having it together
      with some warm milk.</p><p><img class="cms-image-placeholder"

      /></p><h3 id="cbd-oil"><strong>CBD oil</strong></h3><p>Chemical drugs are
      often used for menstrual problems - as they help for the moment.<br
      />Considering the potential consequential damage to your body, these drugs
      should not be your first choice for obvious reasons. I always prefer
      natural remedies in all aspects of life!<br />The good news is that more
      and more women handle problems like abdominal pain, headache or back pain
      without these and other hormone preparations and rather reach the CBD-Oil
      since it is plant-based and natural.&nbsp;<br />With its supportive effect
      on the human endocannabinoid system (ECS). CBD is recognized as a natural
      treatment for several kinds of pain or stress and anxiety.&nbsp;</p><p><br
      />Typical menstrual problems can be defused in its intensity and becoming
      less apparent because CBD has an influence on the bodies pain receptors.
      For our european readers I can totally recommend the so[u]lution
      (<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://bit.ly/soulutionpost">the-soulution.com</a></strong>). The
      products are Bio-Suisse certified, controlled according to European
      guidelines, vegan and produced without animal suffering. You can also use
      the code '<strong>happy10</strong>' to get a discount. I used this CBD oil
      when I was in Germany and it really helped with my period pain, focus and
      overall wellbeing.</p>

### Hot water bottle

I find that applying heat on my belly and back helps significantly with period cramps. You can buy one of those special warm bottles online. Or you can also make it yourself by putting uncooked rice into a sock and microwaving it for a few minutes. Make sure you don’t overheat either of those. It should be slightly warmer than your own body temperature.&nbsp;

### Herbs & Spices

Together with applying some heat on your body, you can try to enjoy a cup of warm herbal tea. The easiest tea that I like to make is hot water with some lemon and ginger. I might also add mint if I have it.

There are also some specific herbs that are proven to have an anti-inflammatory effect on our bodies. These are chamomile, fennel seeds, cinnamon and dill. You can drink them on their own or create your own tea-mix.

A great spice with the same effect is turmeric. You can try adding it to your meals or having it together with some warm milk.

### CBD oil

Chemical drugs are often used for menstrual problems - as they help for the moment.<br>Considering the potential consequential damage to your body, these drugs should not be your first choice for obvious reasons. I always prefer natural remedies in all aspects of life\!<br>The good news is that more and more women handle problems like abdominal pain, headache or back pain without these and other hormone preparations and rather reach the CBD-Oil since it is plant-based and natural.&nbsp;<br>With its supportive effect on the human endocannabinoid system (ECS).

### Self-massage with essential oils

I found that giving my abdominals, sides and back a gentle massage with the right combination of essential oils helps me to relax and reduce the pain. It's even better if Jake does it :P. You can find videos on YouTube, which show specific points that you can press on your body to make the massage even more effective. Or you can simply rub your belly in slow gentle circular motion.&nbsp;

As for essential oils, try to mix a few of your favorite aromas. In general, lavender, clary sage and marjoram are considered to be the relaxing ones. You might want to give them a try first and at the end come up with your own perfect combo.&nbsp;

### Healthy diet&nbsp;

This won’t immediately relieve period cramps but it may have a positive effect over time.

Try including more omega-3 rich foods in your diet and avoid having foods that make you bloat and retain water. I take a daily Omega 3 supplement that I really love from a team I can trust ([you can learn about it here](https://thisismaja.com/posts/supplements-for-plant-based-diet){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}).

Regarding the foods you want to avoid during your period, the list can vary per person but in general, those are:

* Alcohol, fizzy drinks and coffee
* Salty and sugary foods
* Too many fruits can cause bloating. You can replace them with berries instead.&nbsp;
* Fatty and highly processed food

Basically try and eat a 'whole' 'plant' based diet.

### Magnesium

Magnesium is a mineral that plays an important role in hundreds of important chemical reactions in our bodies. Despite that, it is considered that most of the population is magnesium deficient. I got a lot of feedback from girls who have found a lot of relief using magnesium tablets.

One of the benefits of magnesium is the regulation of the nervous system and muscle recovery. It calms your nerves, reduces stress, and relaxes your muscles.

### Gentle exercises&nbsp;

I know it can be unbearable to imagine doing any sort of exercise when the only thing you want to do is lie in bed. The keyword here is “gentle”. Try doing slow stretching and soft yoga flow laying on your back. This will help blood circulation and the release of endorphins.

In this blog post, we talk about which supplements you should take if you are on a plant-based diet and why. We also share the best vegan supplements.
