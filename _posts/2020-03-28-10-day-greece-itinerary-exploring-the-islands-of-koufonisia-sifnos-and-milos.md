      <p>Most travelers flock to the popular islands of Santorini, Mykonos, and
      Corfu which attract thousands of tourists during the summer season.
      However, with this comes crowded beaches, long queues at tourist hotspots,
      and expensive accommodation options.</p><p>In an effort to escape the
      crowds, we opted to visit the lesser-known islands in Greece which are
      often overlooked by travelers. Koufonisia, Sifnos, and Milos seemed to be
      the perfect combination of remoteness and natural beauty and we were
      completely blown away by what they had to offer.</p><p>If you follow our
      10 day Greece itinerary, you&rsquo;ll explore deserted cobblestone
      streets, venture to hidden caves and swim in the bluest waters, leaving
      you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.</p>

      <h2>Greece Itinerary: Athens</h2><p>Athens is the capital city of Greece
      and home to the Acropolis, which holds the remains of many ancient
      buildings. Most international flights arrive in Athens and it&rsquo;s best
      to take advantage of this opportunity and spend the night here.</p><p>The
      Acropolis is open from 08:00 daily. It closes at 16:00 on Mondays and at
      20:00 from Tuesday to Sunday. If you need to get to the Acropolis, the
      easiest and safest way is with <a
      href="https://thebeat.co/en/"><u>Beat</u></a>, a local taxi app which
      connects you to nearby drivers.</p><h3>Athens Accommodation</h3><p>We
      spent our night in Athens at <a
      href="https://www.urbanstripesathens.com/en"><u>Urban Stripes</u></a>, a
      minimalist hotel situated just a stone's throw away from the Acropolis.
      The hotel is located in a friendly neighborhood with plenty of plant-based
      food options nearby. Definitely check out a small vegan, raw cafe called
      'Peas' (the best food we had in Greece)</p>

      <h2>Greece Itinerary: Koufonisia (3 nights)</h2><p>Koufonisia was the
      first island of our 10 day Greece itinerary. It&rsquo;s a tiny island
      located in the heart of the Aegean Sea and the smallest of the 3 we
      visited. Koufonisia is a tranquil island and if you&rsquo;re looking for
      undiscovered island life we&rsquo;d highly recommend you include it in
      your Greece itinerary.</p><h3>How to get to Koufonisia from
      Athens</h3><p>There is no airport on Koufonisia and the only way to access
      the island is via ferry. The ferry departs from Piraeus Port in Athens and
      takes about 5 hours to reach Koufonisia. You can contact<a
      href="https://hellenicseaways.gr/en/"> <u>Hellenic Seaways</u></a> to
      inquire about ticket options.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d prefer a shorter ferry
      trip, you can also fly to nearby Naxos. You then need to catch a ferry
      from Naxos to Koufonisia which takes 2.5 hours.</p>

      <h3>Things to do in Koufonisia</h3><p>Koufonisia is a remote island with
      very few luxuries compared to what you would find on more popular islands.
      If you&rsquo;re big on the nightlife scene, then Koufonisaia is not for
      you. However, if you have an adventurous spirit and a desire to explore
      caves and beautiful beaches, then this is a must-see.</p><h4>1) Explore
      the best beaches in Koufonisia: Pori Beach and Platia
      Punda</h4><ul><li>Pori Beach: Pori Beach is absolutely incredible! This
      beach has crystal clear water and is located next to a large
      cove.</li><li>Platia Punda (Italida) Beach: Platia Punda Beach is the most
      popular beach in Koufonisia</li></ul><h4>2) Take a boat tour around
      Koufonisia</h4><p>We love the sea and can think of no better way to spend
      our day than on a boat, at the heart of the Aegean Sea, surrounded by
      crystal clear waters.</p><p>Koufonisia is actually made up of 3 little
      islands. Ano Koufonisia, the island we stayed on, has permanent residents,
      but Kato Koufonisi and Keros islet are both uninhabited. We stopped off at
      Kato Koufonisi and explored this sleepy island on foot before heading back
      to our hotel.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to do a boat tour around
      Koufonisia, we highly recommend booking through<a
      href="https://www.e-kyklades.gr/showroom/tourism/PRASINOSTOURS?lang=en">
      <u>Prasinos Tours</u></a>.</p><h4>3) Enjoy yoga</h4><p>Our health and
      well-being are so important to us, and despite our hectic schedules, we
      love taking some time out to do yoga. Our instructor came to our hotel and
      we had a couple&rsquo;s yoga session which was absolutely
      incredible.</p><h4>4) Find picturesque spots around Koufonisia</h4><p>The
      cobblestone walkways in Koufonisia are lined with quaint white buildings
      dressed with blue windows and gorgeous bright flowers. These provide the
      perfect setting for any photo, and you won&rsquo;t have to fight the
      crowds to get that snap.</p><h4>5) Freedive and shoot underwater at
      Ksylompatis Caves.</h4><p>One of the coolest places we&rsquo;ve ever had
      the pleasure of seeing. You can find the location&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ksylompatis+Caves/@36.94803,25.6211076,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x66c301b9882e8b6a!8m2!3d36.94803!4d25.6211076"><u>here.</u></a></p><h4>6)
      Explore Koufonisia on bike</h4><p>More adventure awaits! Koufonisia is
      such a small island and the best way to explore is on a bike. You can rent
      these from Bicycles Moscha (mosxaprasinou@hotmail.com).</p>

      <h3>Koufonisia Accommodation</h3><p>We stayed at&nbsp;<a

      and absolutely loved our time here. The cottages are beautifully decorated
      with an incredible open plan kitchen. My Island Home is ideally located

      you&rsquo;re looking to save money, why not make your own food. You can

      Island Home.</li></ul>

      <h2>Greece Itinerary: Sifnos (3 nights)</h2><p>Sifnos, the second stop of
      our 10 day Greece itinerary, is a bigger and busier island than
      Koufonisia. This island is home to quaint villages and beautiful beaches
      and is known to be the culinary and cultural destination of
      Greece.</p><h3>How to get to Sifnos from Koufonisia</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re
      following our 10 day Greece itinerary, you&rsquo;ll arrive in Sifnos via a
      ferry from Koufonisia.<a href="https://www.seajets.gr/">
      <u>Seajets</u></a><u> </u>offer frequent trips from Koufonisia to Sifnos
      and the travel time is just over 4 hours.</p><p>There is no airport on the
      island so taking a ferry is the only way to reach Sifnos.</p><h3>Sifnos
      Accommodation</h3><p>We stayed at<a
      href="https://www.selanasuites.com/en/"> <u>Selena Suites</u></a> on
      Sifnos Island and absolutely loved it.</p><p>Sifnos Restaurants that offer
      plant-based meals:</p><ul><li><a

      <h3>Things to do in Sifnos</h3><h4>1) Visit the most beautiful chapels on
      Sifnos Island</h4><p>Sifnos is home to over 200 churches and monasteries.
      We visited one situated at the top of a hill, overlooking the Aegean Sea.
      It was absolutely gorgeous!</p><p>Be sure to check out&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chrisopigi+Monastery/@36.9364079,24.7441238,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x1498f2f1b0c16ddd:0x3d5ed8e88275d039!8m2!3d36.9364079!4d24.7463125"><u>Chrisopigi
      Monastery</u></a> and&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/%CE%A0%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%AC+%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85+%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%8D/@36.939512,24.7339233,15z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sVirgin+mary+of+the+Mountain+Monastery!3m4!1s0x1498f28c2aa052f5:0x9cc2573bc9be3928!8m2!3d36.9385989!4d24.7321129"><u>Virgin
      Mary of the Mountain Monastery.</u></a> Both can be found on Google
      maps.</p><h4>2) Go back in time at Kastro Village</h4><p>Kastro village is
      an iconic spot in Sifnos and one of the most picturesque villages on the
      island. Narrow walkways lined with traditional Cycladic architecture make
      up the medieval village of Kastro.</p><h4>3) Rent a car in Sifnos and
      explore the island</h4><p>The best way to see all the attractions in
      Sifnos is to rent a car from Sun Trial Car Rental for the duration of your
      stay. You can contact them at motocar@suntrail.gr. The island is quite big
      and it&rsquo;s impossible to see everything on
      foot.</p><h4>&nbsp;</h4><h4>4) Check out these 3 villages in
      Sifnos</h4><p>Sifnos is made up of 14 villages, but the villages of
      Kastro, Artemonas and Apollonia are the most popular. Apollonia is the
      capital town located in the middle of Sifnos Island whilst Artemonas is a
      traditional settlement and the largest village on the island.</p><h4>5)
      Take a swim at one of the best beaches in Sifnos</h4><ul><li>Vathi Beach:
      Vathi Beach is a gorgeous, quiet beach located west of Sifnos. The shallow
      waters are crystal clear and the beach is lined with cute
      restaurants.</li><li>Platis Gialos: This is one of the longest beaches in
      the Cyclades with clear turquoise waters.&nbsp; There are restaurants
      nearby and sunbeds and umbrellas are available.</li></ul><h4>&nbsp;7) Take
      part in a cooking class</h4><p>Sifnos is an island known for its
      extraordinary cuisine. We would have loved to do a vegan cooking class but
      unfortunately, Narlis Farm was fully booked at the time of our visit. This
      is another way to meet the locals and experience the Greek culture with
      some good food and dancing.</p>

      <h2>Greece Itinerary: Milos (3 nights)</h2><p>Milos is the very reason we
      wanted to return to Greece. We traveled to this island 2 years ago and
      were completely blown away by the color of the water and incredible free
      diving.</p><p>Words cannot describe the beauty that lies on Milos Island.
      It&rsquo;s actually a volcanic island with beautiful caves tucked below
      the bright blue waters. Milos is fast becoming a tourist hotspot. It was
      the most popular island on our Greece itinerary, yet it still has that
      unique charm that we love so much.</p><h3>How to get to Milos from Sifnos
      or Athens</h3><p>Milos is just over 60km away from Sifnos and the easiest
      way to get between the two is via ferry. Bookings can be made through<a
      href="https://www.seajets.gr/"> <u>Sea Jets</u></a> and the trip takes
      approximately 40 minutes.</p><p>There is an airport on Milos Island with
      daily flights to and from Athens. If you&rsquo;d prefer to follow our 10
      day Greece itinerary in reverse, you can fly into Milos before moving to
      the islands of Sifnos and Koufonisia.</p><h3>Milos Accommodation</h3><p>We
      stayed at<a href="http://skinopi.com/"> <u>Skinopi Lodge</u></a><u>
      </u>whilst in Milos.</p><h3>Milos Restaurants</h3><ul><li><a
      href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/O-Hamos/377153249022792"><u>O! Hamos
      restaurant</u></a> (possible the best plant-based we had in
      Greece</li><li><a href="https://www.barriello.com/"><u>Bariello
      Mediterranean restaurant</u></a></li></ul>

      <h3>Things to do in Milos</h3><h4>1) Explore Milos on a boat tour with
      Excellent Yachting</h4><p>This was one of our favorite days in Milos.
      Whilst most areas can be accessed from the shore, there are a few
      incredible spots that can only be seen by boat.</p><p>We discovered hidden
      caves and went freediving alongside a shipwreck near Milos. A great spot
      we found was just off the coast of the uninhabited island of Polyaigos.
      The waters here were incredibly blue and we were both completely blown
      away by the beauty.</p><p>You can find out more information on their boat
      trips<a href="https://www.excellentyachting.com/"><u>
      here.</u></a></p><h4>2) Rent a car in Milos and go on an
      adventure</h4><p>Milos is a much bigger island than the other two on our
      Greece itinerary. The best way to explore is by car from<a
      href="http://www.milosrent.gr/"> <u>Milos Rent</u></a><u> </u>and find
      those attractions which are off the beaten track.</p><h4>3) Explore the
      beaches in Milos</h4><ul><li>Sarakiniko Beach: Sarakiniko Beach is located
      to the northeast of Milos and is one of the most picturesque beaches on
      the island. We loved the cliff jumping here and the water was clearer than
      we remembered it to be from our first visit.<a
      href="https://yogajourneymilos.com/"> <u>Yoga Journeys</u></a><u> </u>also
      offer yoga on Sarakiniko Beach.</li></ul><ul><li>Tsigrado Beach: Tsigrado
      beach is a white sandy beach enclosed by massive boulders. To access the
      beach, you&rsquo;ll need to make your way there on a dirt road and climb
      down a step ladder, but the effort will be well worth
      it.</li><li>Fyriplaka: Fyriplaka Beach is one of the most popular beaches
      on Milos Island. Volcanic cliffs surround the beach and it&rsquo;s the
      perfect place to spend your afternoon.</li></ul><h4>4) Go on a wine
      tour</h4><p>Unfortunately, this is one activity we did not get around to
      doing. However, Kostantakis offer a wine tour that&rsquo;s a great
      alternative if you have more time in Milos or if the weather isn&rsquo;t
      playing its part.</p>

      <h3>Best time to visit Koufonisia, Sifnos, and Milos</h3><p>The best time
      to visit Greece is during the summer months from June to August.</p><p>We
      explored the islands of Koufonisia, Sifnos, and Milos at the beginning of
      June and the weather was perfect but the water was still chilly. The
      islands were a lot quieter as peak season continues from mid-July to
      August.</p><h3>How to get to Greece</h3><p>We flew to Greece with Aegean
      Airlines, the multi-awarded Greek Airline. You can check out their
      prices&nbsp;<a href="https://en.aegeanair.com/"><u>here</u></a>.</p>

      <h3>Overall thoughts on our Greece holiday</h3><p>Greece is just one of
      those places that make you smile at every corner. As photographers and
      content creators, our job couldn&rsquo;t have been easier. Just by looking
      around the landscapes, colors, flowers, and architecture, our minds were
      filled with inspiration and wonder.</p><p>We have been amazed by the
      lesser-known sights we were able to discover and we know that Greece has
      thousands more to be uncovered. It won&rsquo;t be long before we are back
      in the crystal clear waters of Greece with the sun on our backs living
      life to the fullest.</p><p>Disclosure: This post was created in
      partnership with&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.discovergreece.com/">Discover
      Greece</a></u>&nbsp;in order to explore islands that you probably
      haven&rsquo;t heard of. As always, all the reviews and opinions expressed
