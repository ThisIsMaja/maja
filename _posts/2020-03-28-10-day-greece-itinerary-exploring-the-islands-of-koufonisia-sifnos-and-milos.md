  <h2>Which islands to include in your Greece
  itinerary?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most travelers flock to the popular islands of
  Santorini, Mykonos, and Corfu which attract thousands of tourists during the
  summer season. However, with this comes crowded beaches, long queues at
  tourist hotspots, and expensive accommodation options.</p><p>In an effort to
  escape the crowds, we opted to visit the lesser known islands in Greece which
  are often overlooked by travelers. Koufonisia, Sifnos, and Milos seemed to be
  the perfect combination of remoteness and natural beauty and we were
  completely blown away by what they had to offer.</p><p>If you follow our 10
  day Greece itinerary, you&rsquo;ll explore deserted cobblestone streets,
  venture to hidden caves and swim in the bluest waters, leaving you feeling
  refreshed and rejuvenated.</p><h3>Day 1 Greece itinerary: Athens (1
  night)</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Athens is the capital city of Greece and home to
  the Acropolis, which holds the remains of many ancient buildings. Most
  international flights arrive in Athens and it&rsquo;s best to take advantage
  of this opportunity and spend the night here.</p><p>The Acropolis is open from
  08:00 daily. It closes at 16:00 on Mondays and at 20:00 from Tuesday to
  Sundays. If you need to get to the Acropolis, the easiest and safest way is
  with&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="”_blank”"
  href="https://thebeat.co/en/">Beat</a>, a local taxi app which connects you to
  nearby drivers.</p><h4>Athens Accommodation</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We spent our
  night in Athens at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="”_blank”"
  href="https://www.urbanstripesathens.com/en">Urban Stripes</a>, a minimalist
  hotel situated just a stone's throw away from the Acropolis. The hotel is
  located in a friendly neighborhood with plenty of plant-based food options
  nearby. Definitely check out a small vegan, raw cafe called 'Peas' (the best
  food we had in Greece)</p><h3>Day 2 - 4 Greece Itinerary: Koufonisia (3
  nights)</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Koufonisia was the first island of our 10 day
  Greece itinerary. It&rsquo;s a tiny island located in the heart of the Aegean
  Sea and the smallest of the 3 we visited. Koufonisia is a tranquil island and
  if you&rsquo;re looking for undiscovered island life we&rsquo;d highly
  recommend you include it in your Greece itinerary.</p><h3>How to get to
  Koufonisia from Athens</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is no airport on Koufonisia
  and the only way to access the island is via ferry. The ferry departs from
  Piraeus Port in Athens and takes about 5 hours to reach Koufonisia. You can
  contact <a target="_blank" href="https://hellenicseaways.gr/en/">Hellenic
  Seaways</a> to inquire about ticket options.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d prefer a
  shorter ferry trip, you can also fly to nearby Naxos. You then need to catch a
  ferry from Naxos to Koufonisia which takes 2.5 hours.</p><h3>Things to do in
  Koufonisia</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Koufonisia is a remote island with very few
  luxuries compared to what you would find on more popular islands. If
  you&rsquo;re big on the nightlife scene, then Koufonisaia is not for you.
  However, if you have an adventurous spirit and a desire to explore caves and
  beautiful beaches, then this is a must see.</p><p>1) Explore the best beaches
  in Koufonisia: Pori Beach and Platia Punda</p><ul><li>Pori Beach: Pori Beach
  is absolutely incredible! This beach has crystal clear water and is located
  next to a large cove.</li><li>Platia Punda (Italida) Beach: Platia Punda Beach
  is the most popular beach in Koufonisia</li></ul><p><strong>2) Take a boat
  tour around Koufonisia</strong></p><p>We love the sea and can think of no
  better way to spend our day than on a boat, at the heart of the Aegean Sea,
  surrounded by crystal clear waters.</p><p>Koufonisia is actually made up of 3
  little islands. Ano Koufonisia, the island we stayed on, has permanent
  residents, but Kato Koufonisi and Keros islet are both uninhabited. We stopped
  off at Kato Koufonisi and explored this sleepy island on foot before heading
  back to our hotel.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to do a boat tour around
  Koufonisia, we highly recommend booking through&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
  href="https://www.e-kyklades.gr/showroom/tourism/PRASINOSTOURS?lang=en">Prasinos
  Tours</a>.</p><p><strong>3) Enjoy yoga</strong></p><p>Our health and
  well-being are so important to us, and despite our hectic schedules, we love
  taking some time out to do yoga. Our instructor came to our hotel and we had a
  couple&rsquo;s yoga session which was absolutely incredible.</p><p><strong>4)
  Find picturesque spots around Koufonisia</strong></p><p>The cobblestone
  walkways in Koufonisia are lined with quaint white buildings dressed with blue
  windows and gorgeous bright flowers. These provide the perfect setting for any
  photo, and you won&rsquo;t have to fight the crowds to get that
  snap.</p><p>Freedive and shoot underwater at Ksylompatis Caves. One of the
  coolest places we&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of seeing. You can find the
  location&nbsp;<a target="_blank"

  Explore Koufonisia on bike</strong></p><p>More adventure awaits! Koufonisia is
  such a small island and the best way to explore is on a bike. You can rent
  these from Bicycles Moscha (mosxaprasinou@hotmail.com).</p><h3>Koufonisia
  Accommodation</h3><p>We stayed at&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
  href="https://myislandhome.gr/">My Island Home</a>&nbsp;in Koufonisia and
  absolutely loved our time here. The cottages are beautifully decorated with an
  incredible open plan kitchen. My Island Home is ideally located nearby Pori
  Beach and the owners are so kind and helpful. We will definitely be revisiting
  one day!!</p><h3>Koufonisia Restaurants that offer plant-based
  meals</h3><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://mikrescyclades.com/">Mikres
  Cyclades</a></li><li>If you&rsquo;re looking to save money, why not make your
  own food. You can buy fresh produce on the island and prepare your own healthy
  meals at My Island Home.</li></ul><h3>Day 5 - 7 Greece Itinerary: Sifnos (3
  nights)</h3><p>Sifnos, the second stop of our 10 day Greece itinerary, is a
  bigger and busier island than Koufonisia. This island is home to quaint
  villages and beautiful beaches and is known to be the culinary and cultural
  destination of Greece.</p><h4>How to get to Sifnos from
  Koufonisia</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re following our 10 day Greece
  itinerary, you&rsquo;ll arrive in Sifnos via a ferry from Koufonisia. <a
  target="_blank" href="https://www.seajets.gr/">Seajets </a>offer frequent
  trips from Koufonisia to Sifnos and the travel time is just over 4
  hours.</p><p>There is no airport on the island so taking a ferry is the only
  way to reach Sifnos.</p><h4>Things to do in
  Sifnos</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1) Visit the most beautiful chapels on
  Sifnos Island</strong></p><p>Sifnos is home to over 200 churches and
  monasteries. We visited one situated at the top of a hill, overlooking the
  Aegean Sea. It was absolutely gorgeous!</p><p>Be sure to check out&nbsp;<a

  Mary of the Mountain Monastery.</a>&nbsp;Both can be found on Google
  maps.</p><p><strong>2) Go back in time at Kastro Village</strong></p><p>Kastro
  village is an iconic spot in Sifnos and one of the most picturesque villages
  on the island. Narrow walkways lined with traditional Cycladic architecture
  make up the medieval village of Kastro.</p><p><strong>3) Rent a car in Sifnos
  and explore the island</strong></p><p>The best way to see all the attractions
  in Sifnos is to rent a car from Sun Trial Car Rental for the duration of your
  stay. You can contact them at motocar@suntrail.gr. The island is quite big and
  it&rsquo;s impossible to see everything on foot.</p><p><strong>4) Check out
  these 3 villages in Sifnos</strong></p><p>Sifnos is made up of 14 villages,
  but the villages of Kastro, Artemonas and Apollonia are the most popular.
  Apollonia is the capital town located in the middle of Sifnos Island whilst
  Artemonas is a traditional settlement and the largest village on the
  island.</p><p><strong>5) Take a swim at one of the best beaches in
  Sifnos</strong></p><ul><li>Vathi Beach: Vathi Beach is a gorgeous, quiet beach
  located west of Sifnos. The shallow waters are crystal clear and the beach is
  lined with cute restaurants.</li><li>Platis Gialos: This is one of the longest
  beaches in the Cyclades with clear turquoise waters. There are restaurants
  nearby and sunbeds and umbrellas are available.</li></ul><p><strong>6) Take
  part in a cooking class</strong></p><p>Sifnos is an island known for its
  extraordinary cuisine. We would have loved to do a vegan cooking class but
  unfortunately, Narlis Farm was fully booked at the time of our visit. This is
  another way to meet the locals and experience the Greek culture with some good
  food and dancing.</p><h4>Sifnos Accommodation</h4><p>We stayed at&nbsp;<a
  target="_blank" href="https://www.selanasuites.com/en/">Selena
  Suites</a>&nbsp;on Sifnos Island and absolutely loved it.</p><h4>Sifnos

  nights)</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Milos is the very reason we wanted to return to
  Greece. We traveled to this island 2 years ago and were completely blown away
  by the color of the water and incredible free diving.</p><p>Words cannot
  describe the beauty that lies on Milos Island. It&rsquo;s actually a volcanic
  island with beautiful caves tucked below the bright blue waters. Milos is fast
  becoming a tourist hotspot. It was the most popular island on our Greece
  itinerary, yet it still has that unique charm that we love so much.</p><h4>How
  to get to Milos from Sifnos or Athens</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Milos is just over
  60km away from Sifnos and the easiest way to get between the two is via ferry.
  Bookings can be made through&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
  href="https://www.seajets.gr/">Sea Jets</a>&nbsp;and the trip takes
  approximately 40 minutes.</p><p>There is an airport on Milos Island with daily
  flights to and from Athens. If you&rsquo;d prefer to follow our 10 day Greece
  itinerary in reverse, you can fly into Milos before moving to the islands of
  Sifnos and Koufonisia.</p><h4>Things to do in
  Milos</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1) Explore Milos on a boat tour with
  Excellent Yachting</strong></p><p>This was one of our favorite days in Milos.
  Whilst most areas can be accessed from the shore, there are a few incredible
  spots that can only be seen by boat.</p><p>We discovered hidden caves and went
  freediving alongside a shipwreck near Milos. A great spot we found was just
  off the coast of the uninhabited island of Polyaigos. The waters here were
  incredibly blue and we were both completely blown away by the
  beauty.</p><p>You can find out more information on their boat trips<a
  target="_blank"
  href="https://www.excellentyachting.com/">&nbsp;here.</a></p><p><strong>2)
  Rent a car in Milos and go on an adventure</strong></p><p>Milos is a much
  bigger island than the other two on our Greece itinerary. The best way to
  explore is by car from&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
  href="http://www.milosrent.gr/">Milos Rent&nbsp;</a>and find those attractions
  which are off the beaten track.</p><p><strong>3) Explore the beaches in
  Milos&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Sarakiniko Beach: Sarakiniko Beach is located
  to the northeast of Milos and is one of the most picturesque beaches on the
  island. We loved the cliff jumping here and the water was clearer than we
  remembered it to be from our first visit.&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
  href="https://yogajourneymilos.com/">Yoga Journeys&nbsp;</a>also offer yoga on
  Sarakiniko Beach.</li><li>Tsigrado Beach: Tsigrado beach is a white sandy
  beach enclosed by massive boulders. To access the beach, you&rsquo;ll need to
  make your way there on a dirt road and climb down a step ladder, but the
  effort will be well worth it.</li><li>Fyriplaka: Fyriplaka Beach is one of the
  most popular beaches on Milos Island. Volcanic cliffs surround the beach and
  it&rsquo;s the perfect place to spend your afternoon.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>4) Go
  on a wine tour</p><p>Unfortunately, this is one activity we did not get around
  to doing. However, Kostantakis offer a wine tour that&rsquo;s a great
  alternative if you have more time in Milos or if the weather isn&rsquo;t
  playing its part.&nbsp;</p><h3>Milos Accommodation</h3><p>We stayed at&nbsp;<a
  target="_blank" href="http://skinopi.com/">Skinopi Lodge&nbsp;</a>whilst in
  Milos.</p><h3>Milos Restaurants</h3><ul><li><a target="_blank"
  href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/O-Hamos/377153249022792">O! Hamos
  restaurant</a>&nbsp;(possible the best plant based we had in Greece</li><li><a
  target="_blank" href="https://www.barriello.com/">Bariello Mediterranean
  restaurant</a></li></ul><h3>best time to visit koufonisia, sifnos, and
  milos</h3><p>The best time to visit Greece is during the summer months from
  June to August.</p><p>We explored the islands of Koufonisia, Sifnos, and Milos
  at the beginning of June and the weather was perfect but the water was still
  chilly. The islands were a lot quieter as peak season continues from mid-July
  to August.</p><h4>how to get to greece</h4><p>We flew to Greece with Aegean
  Airlines, the multi-awarded Greek Airline. You can check out their
  prices&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
  href="https://en.aegeanair.com/">here</a>.</p><h4>overall thoughts on our
  greece holiday</h4><p>Greece is just one of those places that make you smile
  at every corner. As photographers and content creators our job couldn&rsquo;t
  have been easier. Just by looking around the landscapes, colours, flowers and
  architecture our minds were filled with inspiration and wonder.</p><p>We have
  been amazed by the lesser known sights we were able to discover and we know
  that Greece has thousands more to be uncovered. It won&rsquo;t be long before
  we are back in the crystal clear waters of Greece with the sun on our backs
  living life to the fullest.&nbsp;</p><p>Disclosure: This post was created in
  partnership with&nbsp;<a target="_blank"

  explore islands that you probably haven&rsquo;t heard of. As always, all the
