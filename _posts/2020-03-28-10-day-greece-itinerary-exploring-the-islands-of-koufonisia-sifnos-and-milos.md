      <p>Most travelers flock to the popular islands of Santorini, Mykonos, and
      Corfu which attract thousands of tourists during the summer season.
      However, with this comes crowded beaches, long queues at tourist hotspots,
      and expensive accommodation options.</p><p>In an effort to escape the
      crowds, we opted to visit the lesser-known islands in Greece which are
      often overlooked by travelers. Koufonisia, Sifnos, and Milos seemed to be
      the perfect combination of remoteness and natural beauty and we were
      completely blown away by what they had to offer.</p><p>If you follow our
      10 day Greece itinerary, you&rsquo;ll explore deserted cobblestone
      streets, venture to hidden caves and swim in the bluest waters, leaving
      you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.</p>

      <h2>Athens</h2><p>Athens is the capital city of Greece and home to the
      Acropolis, which holds the remains of many ancient buildings. Most
      international flights arrive in Athens and it&rsquo;s best to take
      advantage of this opportunity and spend the night here.</p><p>The
      Acropolis is open from 08:00 daily. It closes at 16:00 on Mondays and at
      20:00 from Tuesday to Sunday. If you need to get to the Acropolis, the
      easiest and safest way is with <a
      href="https://thebeat.co/en/"><u>Beat</u></a>, a local taxi app which
      connects you to nearby drivers.</p><h3>Athens Accommodation</h3><p>We
      spent our night in Athens at <a
      href="https://www.urbanstripesathens.com/en"><u>Urban Stripes</u></a>, a
      minimalist hotel situated just a stone's throw away from the Acropolis.
      The hotel is located in a friendly neighborhood with plenty of plant-based
      food options nearby. Definitely check out a small vegan, raw cafe called
      'Peas' (the best food we had in Greece)</p>

      <h2>Koufonisia (3 nights)</h2><p>Koufonisia was the first island of our 10
      day Greece itinerary. It&rsquo;s a tiny island located in the heart of the
      Aegean Sea and the smallest of the 3 we visited. Koufonisia is a tranquil
      island and if you&rsquo;re looking for undiscovered island life we&rsquo;d
      highly recommend you include it in your Greece itinerary.</p><h3>How to
      get to Koufonisia from Athens</h3><p>There is no airport on Koufonisia and
      the only way to access the island is via ferry. The ferry departs from
      Piraeus Port in Athens and takes about 5 hours to reach Koufonisia. You
      can contact<a href="https://hellenicseaways.gr/en/"> <u>Hellenic
      Seaways</u></a> to inquire about ticket options.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d
      prefer a shorter ferry trip, you can also fly to nearby Naxos. You then
      need to catch a ferry from Naxos to Koufonisia which takes 2.5 hours.</p>

      <h3>Things to do in Koufonisia</h3><p>Koufonisia is a remote island with
      very few luxuries compared to what you would find on more popular islands.
      If you&rsquo;re big on the nightlife scene, then Koufonisaia is not for
      you. However, if you have an adventurous spirit and a desire to explore
      caves and beautiful beaches, then this is a must-see.</p><h4>1) Explore
      the best beaches in Koufonisia: Pori Beach and Platia
      Punda</h4><ul><li>Pori Beach: Pori Beach is absolutely incredible! This
      beach has crystal clear water and is located next to a large
      cove.</li><li>Platia Punda (Italida) Beach: Platia Punda Beach is the most
      popular beach in Koufonisia</li></ul><h4>2) Take a boat tour around
      Koufonisia</h4><p>We love the sea and can think of no better way to spend
      our day than on a boat, at the heart of the Aegean Sea, surrounded by
      crystal clear waters.</p><p>Koufonisia is actually made up of 3 little
      islands. Ano Koufonisia, the island we stayed on, has permanent residents,
      but Kato Koufonisi and Keros islet are both uninhabited. We stopped off at
      Kato Koufonisi and explored this sleepy island on foot before heading back
      to our hotel.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to do a boat tour around
      Koufonisia, we highly recommend booking through<a
      href="https://www.e-kyklades.gr/showroom/tourism/PRASINOSTOURS?lang=en">
      <u>Prasinos Tours</u></a>.</p><h4>3) Enjoy yoga</h4><p>Our health and
      well-being are so important to us, and despite our hectic schedules, we
      love taking some time out to do yoga. Our instructor came to our hotel and
      we had a couple&rsquo;s yoga session which was absolutely
      incredible.</p><h4>4) Find picturesque spots around Koufonisia</h4><p>The
      cobblestone walkways in Koufonisia are lined with quaint white buildings
      dressed with blue windows and gorgeous bright flowers. These provide the
      perfect setting for any photo, and you won&rsquo;t have to fight the
      crowds to get that snap.</p><h4>5) Freedive and shoot underwater at
      Ksylompatis Caves.</h4><p>One of the coolest places we&rsquo;ve ever had
      the pleasure of seeing. You can find the location&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ksylompatis+Caves/@36.94803,25.6211076,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x66c301b9882e8b6a!8m2!3d36.94803!4d25.6211076"><u>here.</u></a></p><h4>6)
      Explore Koufonisia on bike</h4><p>More adventure awaits! Koufonisia is
      such a small island and the best way to explore is on a bike. You can rent
      these from Bicycles Moscha (mosxaprasinou@hotmail.com).</p>
