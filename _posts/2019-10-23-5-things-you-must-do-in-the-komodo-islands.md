  <p>There are times when travelling you are so blown away by a place or an
  experience that you literally cannot find words to describe it. Our tour
  around the Komodo Islands falls into this category! For every stop on the tour
  we could not believe what we were seeing. The variety of landscapes and
  experiences was unbelievable. Incredible hiking, epic sunrises and sunsets,
  jaw-dropping wildlife, diving, pink beaches, sand-bars and clear blue skies
  are just a fraction of what you can expect from the Komodo
  Islands.&nbsp;</p><p>Here we have put together our Ultimate Komodo Islands
  Bucket List to make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out on the experience of a
  lifetime.</p>

      <h2>WITNESS KOMODO DRAGONS ON RINCA ISLAND</h2><p>These Komodo dragons
      have to be seen to be believed. They are huge!! Rinca and Komodo Island
      are the only places in the entire world that you will find these
      prehistoric creatures. Growing up to 3m long and weighing up to 80kg these
      Komodo dragons look like modern-day dinosaurs.&nbsp;</p><p>On Rinca
      Island, a tour guide will guide you around a section of the island to help
      you find some of these creatures. We visited the island during the mating
      season between the months of May and August. This meant that the dragons
      were either quite placid to conserve energy or they were already in their
      holes to lay eggs.&nbsp; We managed to see 4 dragons. The tour guide who
      is also a ranger on the island carefully overlooked as we managed to get
      with 3-4 metres of the female dragons.&nbsp;</p><p>The dragons feed on
      water buffalo, deer, monkeys and birds, all of which we saw on our island
      tour.&nbsp;</p><p>This was an unreal experience. Having watched so many
      animal documentaries as a child this was a huge tick on the bucket list.
      It feels like your on set with David Attenborough, just make sure you
      don&rsquo;t get to close to those sleepy giants!</p>

      <h2>HIKE UP PADAR ISLAND FOR SUNRISE</h2><p>Padar island looks like
      something straight out of Jurassic Park. The steep volcanic mountain
      ranges are surrounded by deep bays which combined, give you a breathtaking
      view from the top. This sunrise was something we will never
      forget.&nbsp;</p><p>The climb to the top takes about 20 minutes, by the
      time the sun is up it can be quite crowded at the top. To avoid the crowds
      and give ourselves the best chance at getting those Insta-worthy pics, we
      turned right at the top of the first set of stairs instead of left. We
      essentially had our own half of the island for all of sunrise. If you like
      avoiding the crowds this could be for you.&nbsp;</p><p>You can always hike
      to the top once the sun is up, the view from the top is still amazing and
      by then the crowd has dispersed giving you a bit more room to
      move.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>SPLASH AROUND AT THE PINK BEACH</h2><p>Have you ever gone on an
      adventure to find a &lsquo;pink beach&rsquo; only to arrive and find that
      it&rsquo;s not really even pink? Well, forget about that here! The Pink
      Beach, or Pantai Merah which it is also called, is one of seven pink
      beaches on the planet and this beach really is pink. This hidden beach
      only accessible by boat gets its pink colour from microscopic animals
      called Foraminifera, which produce a red pigment on the coral
      reefs.</p><p>Arriving at this beach was like a fairytale. We were the only
      people on the beach that stretched for 400m. The water is bright blue and
      as the waves hit the shore it mixes up the pink sand creating a fairyfloss
      looking effect. Absolutely incredible!&nbsp;</p><p>This beach is the
      perfect spot to relax, take some photos, do some snorkelling and just
      marvel at the beauty of our planet. You will notice that the beach is
      super clean. Please keep it that way and take our rubbish with you, maybe
      even pick a few pieces up while your there.</p>

      <h2>SEE A SPECTACULAR PHENOMENON AT KALONG ISLAND</h2><p>As the sun sets
      over Kalong Island the trees begin to rustle with activity. The boats line
      up in the calm water waiting for something spectacular to happen. One bat
      spreads its wings and flies out from the trees. Then 3 bats follow, then 5
      more. All of a sudden thousands of bats fill the pinky, purple sky. The
      bats are flying back to the mainland to sleep overnight. This daily
      migration is one of the most beautiful things we have ever seen and an
      unexpected part of our Komodo islands tour. You really have to see this
      for yourself to believe it, trust us when we say that you will be in awe
      of this amazing event.</p>

      <h2>ESCAPE TO PARADISE AT TAKA MAKASSAR</h2><p>When we think of paradise,
      this is what comes to mind. Crystal clear water, bright white sand and
      your own secluded sand bar to share with other
      travellers.&nbsp;</p><p>This sand bar is smaller than a football field and
      is surrounded by stunning blue water. The water is shallow therefore the
      biggest cannot get to close which makes it perfect for snorkelling and
      free diving.&nbsp;</p><p>Our camera equipment got a workout at this
      amazing natural wonder. We captured amazing aerial photos and videos with
      our Mavic Pro, some pristine underwater shots with our GoPro 6 and white
      beach couple shots that never get old on our Panasonic
      GH4.&nbsp;</p><p>Take your time to relax or go crazy taking photos, either
      way, you will love this place.</p><p>As content creators and travellers in
      general, this tour around the Komodo Islands was something we will never
      forget. The quality of content we were able to produce and the experiences
      we had, were absolutely top-notch.</p><p>We want to say a big thank you to
