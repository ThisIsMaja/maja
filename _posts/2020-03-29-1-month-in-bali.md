      <h2>Canggu - 6 days</h2><p>One hour from the Denpasar Airport on a good
      day and 2 1/2 hours on a bad day is a suburb called Canggu. Known for its

      friendly cafe&rsquo;s/restaurants and is the perfect place to settle into
      Bali life.</p><p>We have spent our time here trying to surf, eating the

    body-content_html: >-
      <h2>Uluwatu - 4 days</h2><p>A lot of people arrive in Bali, make it to
      their hotel, unpack their bags then head to the beach and are shocked that
      the sand isn&rsquo;t white. Bali is most definitely a tropical paradise
      but it is not known for its pristine beaches&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
      unless you&rsquo;re in Uluwatu. One of our favourite places in Bali, we
      make sure to spend at least a few days here everytime we come back. The
      beaches are surrounded by huge jagged cliff faces, the sand is white and
      the water is super clear. Generally a lot quieter than Canggu and
      Seminyak. Uluwatu is definitely the place to go if your looking to relax
      on the beach.&nbsp;</p><h3>Where to eat in Uluwatu</h3><ul><li>Bukit Cafe

      <h2>Ubud - 4 days</h2><p>Some people say that Ubud is more like a culture
      than a place and honestly when you&rsquo;re there, it feels like it. A
      hideaway for Yogi&rsquo;s, spiritual healers, naturopath&rsquo;s,
      environmentalists and artists. Ubud is heaven for plant based eaters,
      filled with cafe&rsquo;s and restaurants catered to a more compassionate
      lifestyle. Surrounded by waterfalls and filled with markets, spending 4
      days in Ubud could either be a relaxing escape or a wild

      <h2>Gili Islands - 5 days</h2><p>About an hour ferry from Padang Bay on
      the main island of Bali sits Gili Air (least developed, 3 dive shops,
      escape the hustle and bustle) Gili Meno (smallest, quiet, relaxing), and
      Gili Trawangan (biggest, party island, diving). Combined, these islands
      offer more of a Caribbean vibe with amazing diving and snorkelling. If
      you&rsquo;re looking to spend some more time in the water searching for
      turtles and other incredible marine animals, the Gili Islands is your best
      bet. There are no motorised vehicles on these islands which gives it a
      relaxing and peaceful atmosphere.&nbsp;</p><p>*Please educate yourself on
