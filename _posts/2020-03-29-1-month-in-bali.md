  <p>&nbsp;</p><h2>First stop - Canggu​​​​​​</h2><p>1 hour from the Denpasar
  Airport on a good day and 2 1/2 hours on a bad day is a suburb called Canggu.
  Known for its passionate surfing and digital nomad communities, its pumping
  nightlife and its all-round great vibe. Canggu is full of the most stylish
  vegan friendly cafe&rsquo;s/restaurants and is the perfect place to settle
  into Bali life. We have spent our time here trying to surf, eating the most
  amazing plant based food and enjoying the relaxed lifestyle of this special
  place. If you are looking for a place to settle in and work on your blog or
  edit your photos. Canggu is the perfect place.&nbsp;</p><h3>eat

  people arrive in Bali, make it to their hotel, unpack their bags then head to
  the beach and are shocked that the sand isn&rsquo;t white. Bali is most
  definitely a tropical paradise but it is not known for its pristine
  beaches&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; unless you&rsquo;re in Uluwatu. One of our
  favourite places in Bali, we make sure to spend at least a few days here
  everytime we come back. The beaches are surrounded by huge jagged cliff faces,
  the sand is white and the water is super clear. Generally a lot quieter than
  Canggu and Seminyak. Uluwatu is definitely the place to go if your looking to
  relax on the beach.&nbsp;</p><h3>eat at</h3><p>Bukit Cafe (healthy,
  organic)</p><p>La Baracca (amazing Italian food, vegan options)</p><p>Cashew

  amazing blue water</p><p>Check out these beaches Bingin, Thomas, Karma, Green
  Bowl and Blue point.</p><h2>Experience the Jungle - Ubud</h2><p>4
  days</p><p>Some people say that Ubud is more like a culture than a place and
  honestly when you&rsquo;re there, it feels like it. A hideaway for
  Yogi&rsquo;s, spiritual healers, naturopath&rsquo;s, environmentalists and
  artists. Ubud is heaven for plant based eaters, filled with cafe&rsquo;s and
  restaurants catered to a more compassionate lifestyle. Surrounded by
  waterfalls and filled with markets, spending 4 days in Ubud could either be a
  relaxing escape or a wild adventure.&nbsp;</p><h3>eat at</h3><p>Sayuri Healing

  an hour ferry from Padang Bay on the main island of Bali sits Gili Air (least
  developed, 3 dive shops, escape the hustle and bustle) Gili Meno (smallest,
  quiet, relaxing), and Gili Trawangan (biggest, party island, diving).
  Combined, these islands offer more of a Caribbean vibe with amazing diving and
  snorkelling. If you&rsquo;re looking to spend some more time in the water
  searching for turtles and other incredible marine animals, the Gili Islands is
  your best bet. There are no motorised vehicles on these islands which gives it
  a relaxing and peaceful atmosphere. *Please educate yourself on the working
  conditions of these horses before you choose to ride on the carts</p><h2>Gili

  our time on the islands. Our favourite Island was Ceningan, the smallest of
  the 3. On these islands you will find a mixture of white sand beaches, huge
  cliffs and rock formations, surf breaks, palm tree forests and awesome dive
  spots. Rent a scooter and explore to your hearts content, but we weary of the
  the roads (not in the best condition).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
