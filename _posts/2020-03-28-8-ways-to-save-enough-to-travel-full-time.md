  If travelling the world was easy, everybody would do it. It takes sacrifice,
  youâ€™ll have to give some things up
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>When it comes to the topic of how we afford so much travel it is easy to
  assume that we come from &lsquo;family money&rsquo; or that we get all
  expenses paid trips to advertise everything we do. It is a lot harder to learn
  the truth. The truth is, anybody can do what we do! Maybe photography,
  videography and blogging isn&rsquo;t your jam but in terms of travel anybody
  who has the courage to take a chance and the commitment to see something
  through, can travel us much as us.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two things that stop
  most people from living their dreams, its a lack of these two things. Time and
  money! You might want to travel the world like us, you might need more time
  and money to start up that business idea you&rsquo;ve been thinking about,
  maybe you want to buy a house or a block of land or even just spend more time
  with your loved ones. Everybody is different, we all want different things but
  there are somethings we wish we all had more of, time and money fall into that
  category. There are three sides to the dilemma of affording travel, first of
  all how do you make the money in the first place? Secondly how do you save it?
  And thirdly how do you find the freedom to spend it the way you want?</p>

      How many people do you hear say they would love to become a musician, a
      wedding planner, a DJ, a freelance photographer, or even a travel blogger
    body-content_html: "<h4>find seasonal work</h4><p>There are thousands of jobs you could take in order to earn the capital you need to kickstart your dreams. The problem is most jobs to start don&rsquo;t pay particularly well. Also how many of these jobs can you leave after 3-6 months and expect to return the following year? This is where seasonal jobs can really make a difference. This is without a doubt the main reason we are able to do what we do! We work super hard for 4 months a year in the wine industry in Australia saving up every penny, then we hit the road for 8 months. Just to be clear, this lifestyle isn&rsquo;t what we plan to do forever. The beauty of working seasonal jobs is not only do you save up the money to travel, you free up the time to pursue what it is you really desire, your passion projects! How many people do you hear say they would love to become a musician, a wedding planner, a DJ, a freelance photographer, or even a travel blogger \U0001F609 but they just don&rsquo;t have the time to get started? Fill out our contact form if you want more information on how you can get a seasonal job like ours!</p><h4>spend time doing enjoyable things that don&rsquo;t cost money</h4><p>In the past it was always things like drinks with friends that held us both back from hitting our savings goals. One drink would lead to another and the next thing we know we&rsquo;ve spent $100-200 in one night. Thats like a weeks travel budget in Asia \U0001F648 We have learnt to enjoy the things that money cant buy like a beautiful sunset, or a walk at the beach, park, forest etc. When you find enjoyment in activities that don&rsquo;t cost any money you will notice a real difference in the amount you can save. It is important that when you&rsquo;re working hard to save you don&rsquo;t stay in your house cooped up all day. It is not sustainable and you won&rsquo;t get that daily motivation to help you stick to your goals.&nbsp;</p><h4>spend time doing enjoyable things that can potentially make you money</h4><p>Spend time doing enjoyable things that can potentially make you money! In this day and age there are an infinite amount of ways to make money. If you develop a skill or learn knowledge that other people are willing to pay for,&nbsp; you are well on your way to creating a side income. In terms of travel, this means you can make money any where in the world by using your skill or teaching your knowledge. This is the holy grail of long term travel. Now if you can find a hobby with earning potential that you actually enjoy, you will find that mastering your hobby of choice comes easy. All of a sudden you have an avenue to make income while you travel. For us, our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mariefeandjakesnow.com/category/photography/\">photography</a>&nbsp;and influence has become this avenue, we know people who teach surf lessons, others who teach yoga, some people write blogs, others do graphic design or make videos. Whatever it is, if you can find something you enjoy that has earning potential, spend time mastering it!</p>"
