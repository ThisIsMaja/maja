  If travelling the world was easy, everybody would do it. It takes sacrifice,
  youâ€™ll have to give some things up
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>When it comes to the topic of how we afford so much travel it is easy to
  assume that we come from &lsquo;family money&rsquo; or that we get all
  expenses paid trips to advertise everything we do. It is a lot harder to learn
  the truth. The truth is, anybody can do what we do! Maybe photography,
  videography and blogging isn&rsquo;t your jam but in terms of travel anybody
  who has the courage to take a chance and the commitment to see something
  through, can travel us much as us.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two things that stop
  most people from living their dreams, its a lack of these two things. Time and
  money! You might want to travel the world like us, you might need more time
  and money to start up that business idea you&rsquo;ve been thinking about,
  maybe you want to buy a house or a block of land or even just spend more time
  with your loved ones. Everybody is different, we all want different things but
  there are somethings we wish we all had more of, time and money fall into that
  category. There are three sides to the dilemma of affording travel, first of
  all how do you make the money in the first place? Secondly how do you save it?
  And thirdly how do you find the freedom to spend it the way you want?</p>
