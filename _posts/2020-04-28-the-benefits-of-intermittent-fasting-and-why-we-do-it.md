title: The benefits of intermittent fasting and why we do it
meta-description: >-
  We didn’t start intermittent fasting 2 years ago because we thought it would
  be fun. We gave it a try because there were several studies at the time that
  highlighted a lot of potential benefits and in our minds it only made sense
  that if our bodies were constantly using up energy to digest food, then that
  energy could never be focused on other important bodily functions like muscle
  & cell repair, memory retention, flushing out toxins etc.

  <p>When people ask us &lsquo;what&rsquo;s your secret? How do you stay in
  shape and stay healthy while travelling the world with minimal to no
  routine?&rsquo; Our answer is, we don&rsquo;t have a secret but we have been
  eating a whole plant-based diet for 5 years and we&rsquo;ve been intermittent
  fasting for 2 years. If we had to try to assess the effect these two factors
  have on our overall health, we would attribute around 80% of the reason we
  feel so healthy and energized to these two lifestyle choices!</p><p>Of course,
  this is our opinion on how we feel, but we didn&rsquo;t start intermittent
  fasting 2 years ago because we thought it would be fun. We gave it a try
  because there were several studies that highlighted a lot of potential
  benefits. In our minds it only made sense that if our bodies were constantly
  using up energy to digest food, then that energy could never be focused on
  other important bodily functions like muscle &amp; cell repair, memory
  retention, flushing out toxins etc.</p><p>But can intermittent fasting really
  become part of a healthy eating plan for you? Isn&rsquo;t intermittent fasting
  the diet where you need to starve yourself for hours on end? This is not what
  fasting is. To be clear we do not strictly watch the clock every single day
  and start eating the minute we hit 16 hours fasted. Marie will fast on around
  50% of days while I&rsquo;ll fast on most.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><strong>What is intermittent fasting?</strong></h4><p>Fasting and
      starvation are not the same things. When practised correctly and safely,
      fasting has been scientifically proven to have many positive benefits
      which we will get to shortly.</p><p>Fasting is voluntary abstaining or
      partly abstaining from food for a certain period of time. Our nomadic
      ancestors lived like this for thousands of years. Even today, religious
      groups like Muslims, Christians, and Buddhist monks practice
      fasting.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>How do you do intermittent
      fasting?</strong></h4><p>When you do intermittent fasting, you cycle
      through periods of eating (called the eating window) and periods of not
      eating. The most popular intermittent fasting plan out there is the 16:8
      plan.</p><p>On the 16:8 plan, your eating window during the day is 8
      hours, where after you don&rsquo;t eat for 16 hours. For example if you
      eat your dinner at 8pm then your next meal will be at 12noon the next day
      for a 16 hour fast. If you are really looking to optimise your health and
      lose some weight, it&rsquo;s a good idea to eat a healthy whole
      plant-based diet. Fill your meals with fresh fruits and vegetables during
      your eating window. Combining both a whole plant-based diet and
      intermittent fasting is where we believe the magic results appear.
      Remember, if you consume any form of calories within your fasting window
      it will break the fast. Your stomach will start the digestion process and
      you will not reap the benefits of being in a fasting state.</p><p>In the
      beginning, it can be hard to adjust and you might find yourself a bit
      irritable and hungry in the morning. In our experience, it took about one
      month to become used to being fasted in the morning. Now it is a part of
      our everyday life and we even do full workouts having not eaten for over
      12-14 hours.</p>

      <h4><strong>What happens to your body when you
      fast?</strong></h4><p>Something amazing happens to your body when you
      fast. Instead of using glucose for energy, your body switches to a process
      called ketogenesis. It starts burning fat, producing ketones that are used
      for energy. When we start using ketones for energy instead of glucose, it
      can actually enhance our physical and mental endurance and reboot a
      sluggish metabolism.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What are the benefits of
      intermittent fasting?</strong></h4><p>Before we get into the
      scientifically proven benefits I will speak about the benefits we have
      personally noticed in ourselves.</p><ul><li>Our energy and focus has
      greatly improved, especially in the morning</li><li>Our muscles feel less
      sore after workouts</li><li>We need to workout a lot less to stay in great
      shape</li><li>We rarely ever feel bloated</li><li>We feel more in tune
      with our bodies and what they really need</li></ul><p>Here&rsquo;s some of
      the benefits of intermittent fasting research has
      observed:</p><ul><li>Increased weight loss</li><li>Improves memory,
      cognitive function, and clarity of mind</li><li>Gives you more
      energy</li><li>Has anti-inflammatory effects</li><li>Has anti-aging
      effects and helps to heal the body on a cellular level</li><li>Protects
      against chronic disease like diabetes and cardiovascular disease</li></ul>

      <h4><strong>Tips for intermittent fasting and what you can do to help
      yourself get through</strong></h4><p>Once you fall into the rhythm of an
      intermittent fasting lifestyle, you will realise it&rsquo;s not that
      difficult to stick to. It will become a natural way for you to eat. If you
      feel the need you can drink black coffee with no milk and no sugar or
      herbal tea. You can also try apple cider vinegar in the morning which
      helps with digestion and doesn&rsquo;t break your fast.&nbsp;</p><p>We
      also make sure to never consume any calories after 8.30pm. It means that
      the latest we ever eat the next day is 12.30pm. And while we are on the
      topic of the fasting window, don&rsquo;t be so strict that you&rsquo;re
      constantly watching the clock. If you have fasted for 15 hours and you
      need to eat before you go out, then eat. If you know you will be out all
      day and you only have one opportunity to eat some food in the morning,
      have a bite to eat.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only are there multiple
      scientifically-proven benefits including anti-aging effects and increased
      weight loss. It is a lesson in will power and a way for us to break the
      control food has over our mood and the way we spend our time. It has
      improved our lives in many ways and we believe it can do the same for you
      if you give it a chance.</p><p>Subscribe to our <strong><a
      href="/subscribe">newsletter</a></strong> where we will share with you the
      best resources we have found on the topic including podcasts, articles,
      and books from experts in the field.</p><p><u>Let us know in the comments
