  It wasnâ€™t too long ago that we were going through all of the settings in our
  camera with absolutely no idea of what everything did.
intro-content_html: "<p>If there is one thing we are good at, its couple photos. We get asked all the time &ldquo;who takes your photos&rdquo;. Most people think we travel around with a 3rd wheel professional photographer that follows us wherever we go \U0001F605. This is not the case! Sometimes we wish we did have a third person because that would make our lives a lot easier, but wheres the fun in that?&nbsp;</p><p>Just to make it clear and hopefully this will give you some more hope. We definitely do not classify ourselves as professional photographers, everything we have learnt about photography is self taught. It wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that we were going through all of the settings in our camera with absolutely no idea of what everything did. Give us a \U0001F590\U0001F3FD in the comments if you know what thats like.</p><p>So how do we do it?&nbsp;</p>"

      <h3>NO. 1 BUY A TRIPOD</h3><p>First of all you will need a tripod, this is
      absolutely essential. We like to buy sturdy but relatively cheap tripods
      because we always ruin them buy putting them in salt water and other
      places they shouldn&rsquo;t be. If you want to get the &lsquo;shot&rsquo;
      you will need to put your tripod in places it shouldn&rsquo;t
      be.&nbsp;</p><h3>NO. 2 FRAME THE SHOT</h3><p>Once you have found the
      perfect spot and positioned your tripod you will need to frame your shot.
      Composition is key, make sure your place yourselves thoughtfully in the
      photo. An advantage of being a couple is that you can send one person out
      into the frame to judge where exactly the best place to be is. Be natural
      and enjoy yourself, it is easy to tell if a photo contains true
      happiness&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>NO. 3 SET YOUR CAMERA TO TIME-LAPSE MODE</h3><p>A very important part
      of taking great couple photos is the settings in your camera. All cameras
      have different functions but most will have a time lapse feature. After we
      have framed the shot will set our camera to time-lapse mode and set the
      time-lapse to shoot 1 photo every 3 seconds. We also set the camera to
      auto focus mode to make sure the camera stays focused while we move
      around. After we have set this all up we take the first shot, then wait to
      hear the camera snapping away in time-lapse before we get into the
      position we have chosen to place ourselves in the frame. Taking your
      photos this way will lead to much more candid and authentic shots. Instead
      of standing there waiting for the timer to go off or trying to hide your
      phone while you use it as a remote, you can just enjoy yourself and the
      location you are at and let the camera do its thing.&nbsp;</p><h3>NO. 4
      DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM</h3><p>In this day and age learning how to edit your
      photos post shoot is just as important as taking the photos in the first
      place. It really is amazing what you can do on modern day photo editing
      programs. The powerhouse of editing software is Adobe Lightroom. If you
      haven&rsquo;t already subscribed to the Adobe Cloud, you should if you
      want to up your photo game. The Lightroom subscription goes for about
      $14.99, it is worth every cent. Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded the software
      just play around. It will take some time to figure out how to use all the
      functions and to edit your photos to a point that you are happy with, but
      thats ok. Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day.</p>

      <h3>NO.5 GET YOURSELF SOME PRESETS</h3><p>If you want to fast forward the
      learning process in Lightroom and skip to having amazing photos straight
      up then you can buy some presets. A Preset is basically a customised
      template/filter that you can apply onto any photo and it will
      automatically adjust the tones, presence, highlights, shadow, colours etc
      etc. Buying and applying presets onto your photos are a great way to learn
      how to configure the settings for your photos. Then you can adjust or
      tweak the settings to your liking from there. Most photographers/travel
      bloggers/content creators on instagram will have a preset package for
      sale. If you find an instagrammer with a style of photography that you
      like and you want your photos to turn out similar, then buying their
      presets is a good place to start.&nbsp;</p><p>It took us more than a while
      to really get into our groove and our style. Don&rsquo;t be disheartened
      if your photos aren&rsquo;t turning out exactly how you would like, thats
      all a part of the process. Just enjoy yourself and have fun with it and
      practise, practise, practise. Check out some of best shots below. If you
      are looking for more inspiration and ideas for your couple shots, head

      Love&nbsp;</p><p>Marie and Jake</p>
