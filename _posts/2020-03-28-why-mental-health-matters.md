  When I (Marie) was 24 years old, my father passed away. The months following
  this event have probably been the hardest, most emotional ones of my entire
  life.
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>Losing someone you love and have known since the day you were born is
  hurtful and feels completely surreal. Events like this can really mess with
  your mind and cause damage to your mental health without you even realising
  it.</p><p>As with any other event in life that throws you off course, you
  eventually learn to deal with it and move on. I certainly did, too &ndash; but
  the scars in my heart are still there. Up until this day.</p><p>I never
  thought that I would ever be the kind of person to admit that I am struggling
  and actively ask for help. All I wanted during this time was to feel
  understood, heard, seen, felt. Supported. Less lonely with my pain.</p><p>When
  I fell in love for the first time, I brought a lot of emotional pain into this
  relationship.</p><p>The fear of losing someone I love has haunted me since the
  day my father left us, and losing my back-then boyfriend felt simply horrible.
  Feeling attachment towards someone isn&rsquo;t healthy, but I couldn&rsquo;t
  help it.</p><p>I needed someone to have my back, hold space for me and let me
  know that they would never leave. Which was exactly what happened after 5
  years of being together.</p><p>In 2016, one year after my dad had passed away,
  I started working with a Life Coach, Erica, who helped me gain clarity on a
  lot of past traumas that had manifested into my physical reality back
  then.</p>
main-paragraph-emphasis: Take a social media timeout to avoid cluttering your mind
body-content_html: >-
  <ol><li><strong>Follow the rules of the country you are currently
  in</strong>&nbsp;for your own safety and those around
  you.</li><li><strong>Take a step back and turn your situation
  positive.</strong>&nbsp;Allowing negative emotions to fester because you are
  feeling upset or pressured can affect your mental health and productivity.
  Creating positive affirmations like &lsquo;I will get through this&rsquo; can
  make a big difference.</li><li><strong>Stick with your normal routine the best
  you can.</strong>&nbsp;Example: don&rsquo;t go into a panic because you cannot
  go to the gym anymore. Find a home exercise alternative and stick to your
  routine, this will help you to stay calm and productive.</li><li><strong>Reach
  out to loved ones.</strong>&nbsp;Now is a good time to say those things you
  need to say. You never know, the other person might just be needing your
  support more than you realise.</li><li><strong>Take a social media
  timeout&nbsp;</strong>to avoid cluttering your mind with inflated panic.
  Choose one valid resource to get your coronavirus information from and only
  allow yourself to check it once a day. If you feel the itch to check your
  socials more, look at a funny cat video instead.</li><li><strong>Make a
  &lsquo;worry-list&rsquo;&nbsp;</strong>about what is freaking you out because
  of the virus. Writing it down and meditating over it will most likely have you
  realise you are overreacting and give you possible solutions to your
  worries.</li><li><strong>Create new healthy habits.</strong>&nbsp;Do more yoga
  self-practice, eat more vitamin-loaded fruits and vegetables, sleep more.
  These are good habits to improve not only your immune system but your overall
  health.</li><li><strong>Practice meditation and mindfulness</strong>&nbsp;with
  positive affirmations to keep yourself calm and productive during a
  crisis.</li><li><strong>Be grateful</strong>&nbsp;for what you have and
  realise that it is probably enough.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t be
  selfish&nbsp;</strong>and panic buy. Leave some for everyone.</li></ol><p>It
  is important to stay true to yourself during this time and not get lost in the
  sea of over-information and crisis. If you can anchor yourself, stay calm and
  positive, you can become a support anchor for those in your immediate
  community. Positivity, just like panic, can be contagious, and once it takes
  flight it&rsquo;s hard to stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
