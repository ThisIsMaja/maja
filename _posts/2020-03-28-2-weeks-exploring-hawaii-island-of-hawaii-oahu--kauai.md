      <h2>Island of Hawaii (big island)</h2><p>The Island of Hawaii is the
      youngest and largest of all the Hawaiian Islands. Nearly twice the size of
      all the other islands combined, it is still growing.</p><p>There are two
      main cities on the Island of Hawaii - Kona is on the West side, and Hilo
      is on the East. We stayed in Kona, which is the more popular of the two,
      and loved the vibe and energy that came along with it.</p><p>The Island of
      Hawaii exceeded all our expectations as every corner brings with it
      dramatically different landscapes and exciting new adventures. From
      cascading waterfalls, to glittering, black sand beaches, scenic hiking
      routes and majestic volcanoes, the Island of Hawaii is an explorers
      paradise!</p><p>We recommend that you spend at least 4 days here. but even
      longer if you have the time!</p>

      <h2>Things To Do On The Island Of Hawaii</h2><ul><li><h3>Explore Hawaii
      Volcanoes National Park</h3></li></ul><p>One of the main attractions on
      the Island of Hawaii is Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which is easily
      accessible and a must-visit.</p><p>We spent an afternoon exploring here
      and ended our day by watching the most incredible sunset. The sky was
      bright pink as we stood there, on the rim of the crater, with steam rising
      from the volcano, and mingling with the dusky shades of the sky.</p><p>It
      was a surreal experience and one of those &ldquo;pinch me&rdquo; kind of
      moments.</p><p>Costs to visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park</p><p>We
      joined<a href="https://www.epiclava.com/"> <u>Epic Lava&rsquo;s Volcano
      Park Tour</u></a><u> </u>and met with their team at the Kilauea Visitor
      Center.</p><p>The tour prices start from $125 per person for the 4-hour
      tour, which we highly recommend. Their guides are extremely passionate
      about the island, and the history behind the park.</p><p>If this is out of
      your price range, you can also visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
      independently.</p><p>The entrance fee is only $25 per car which gives you
      access for the whole week.</p><ul><li><h3>Go
      canoeing</h3></li></ul><p>After arriving on the Island of Hawaii, we were
      so excited to get out and about! We checked into our hotel and headed
      straight to the beach, got a canoe and paddled out into the ocean for
      sunset.</p><p>You can rent canoes from Kona Boys Beach Shack on Kona
      Beach.</p><ul><li><h3>Take part in a Hula Class</h3></li></ul><p>The hula
      dance is synonymous with Hawaii but not many people know the meaning
      behind it or get a chance to experience this unique dance
      firsthand.</p><p>The Hula dance expresses the local beliefs and their
      culture, as well as respect for the environment around us. Learning more
      about the Hawaiian culture was a great introduction to our stay on the
      Hawaiian Islands.</p><ul><li><h3>Go snorkeling with Manta
      Rays</h3></li></ul><p>Snorkeling with Manta Rays at night was a magical
      experience and one of the highlights of our time in Hawaii.</p><p>They are
      huge and may seem quite scary at first, but they&rsquo;re calm, gentle
      giants.</p><p>Our manta experience was organized by<a
      href="https://www.anelakaiadventures.com/"> <u>Anelakaia
      Adventures,</u></a> an eco-friendly tour operator in Hawaii. We ventured
      out from Kona and made our way into the ocean on a canoe with no
      engine.</p><p>Snorkeling at night when you&rsquo;re surrounded by Manta
      Rays can be quite intimidating, but our guide made sure that we were
      relaxed and felt safe before getting in.</p><p>The tour costs $109 per
      person and is worth every penny.</p><ul><li><h3>Go for a
      hike</h3></li></ul><p>When you&rsquo;re visiting the Island of Hawaii,
      adventure is on your doorstep. And the best way to take it all in is to
      explore on foot. This is exactly what we did when we visited Pololu
      Valley, the northernmost valley of the extinct volcano, Kohala.</p><p>As
      we stood there, high up on the cliffs, we watched the waves as they
      crashed in all their might against the rocks below.</p><p>The Pololu
      Valley hike is towards the North of the island, about 1.5 hours&rsquo;
      drive from Kona. The route is well marked and not crowded. Highly
      recommended!</p><ul><li><h3>Visit a black sand
      beach</h3></li></ul><p>Pololu Beach is a black sand beach on the northern
      coast of the Island of Hawaii. The bay is surrounded by towering cliffs
      and is completely deserted.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a great outing to pair with
      the Pololu Valley hike above, even in the rain!</p><ul><li><h3>Make some
      delicious Kona coffee</h3></li></ul><p>We joined<a
      href="https://www.ucc-hawaii.com/"> <u>UCC Hawaii</u></a> and got our
      hands dirty roasting our very own coffee in Kona. The team explained the
      entire coffee-making process and we enjoyed a few cups of our freshly
      roasted coffee after!</p><p>The coffee tour costs $45 per person which
      includes 2 bags of coffee with your own custom label.</p><ul><li><h3>Check
      out the largest waterfall in Hawaii</h3></li></ul><p>At 135m high, Akaka
      Waterfall is Hawaii&rsquo;s largest waterfall and one of the best places
      to visit on the Island of Hawaii.</p><p>It&rsquo;s located east of the
      island, close to Hilo. The waterfall is a short walk from the parking lot
      and entrance is $5 per car.</p>

      <h3>Where To Eat On The Island Of Hawaii</h3><p>We were so impressed with
      all the vegan options available and highly recommend the below restaurants
      on the Island of Hawaii.</p><ul><li>Sweet Potato Kitchen</li><li>Pōmaikaʻi
      Cafe</li><li>Sweet Cane Cafe</li><li>Vibe</li><li>Conscious Culture
      Cafe</li><li>Under the Bodhi Tree</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Where To Stay
      On The Island Of Hawaii</h3><ul><li>Luxury:<a
      href="https://www.fairmont.com/orchid-hawaii/"> <u>Fairmont Orchid</u></a>
      - This luxurious resort is the perfect place to return to after a full day
      of exploring. They also have kayaks, SUP&rsquo;s and snorkeling equipment
      which you can use and there are turtles right on the beach in front of the
      hotel.</li><li>Budget: We love staying in self-catering apartments when
      we&rsquo;re traveling. Not only are they cheaper than hotels, but you can
      also prepare your own meals so you save costs by not eating out. Places

      <h2>Oahu</h2><p>After a few days exploring the Island of Hawaii, we were
      excited to move on to Oahu.</p><p>Although it&rsquo;s a smaller island
      when compared to the Island of Hawaii, Oahu has a lot of attractions and
      the beaches here are some of the best in Hawaii.</p>

      <h2>Things To Do In Oahu</h2><ul><li><h3>Kualoa Ranch Private Nature
      Reserve</h3></li></ul><p>This is the day we were most excited for!<a
      href="https://www.kualoa.com/"> <u>Kualoa Ranch</u></a><u> </u>is a 4 000
      acre nature reserve located on the East coast of Oahu.</p><p>Remember the
      movies Jurassic Park, Jumanji, Mighty Joe Young, and Godzilla? And who can
      forget Lost or 50 First Dates! Well, Kualoa Ranch is the filming location
      for all of these. How crazy is that!</p><p>There are various tours
      starting from $40 per person, going up to $150 depending on your
      preferences.</p><ul><li><h3>Watch dolphins on a boat
      tour</h3></li></ul><p>The highlight of all our trips involves some sort of
      adventure, and this was no different!</p><p>We headed West of Oahu for a
      boat trip where we spent the morning watching dolphins and
      free-diving.</p><p>This 4-hour boat tour with<a
      href="https://sailhawaii.com/"> <u>Wild Side Speciality Tours</u></a><u>
      </u>costs $175 per person which includes your snorkeling gear, lunch,
      snacks, and water.</p><ul><li><h3>Explore Haleiwa</h3></li></ul><p>Haleiwa
      is located on Oahu&rsquo;s north shore and is famous for its big waves and
      great beaches.</p><p>This is where all the big surfing competitions take
      place so if you&rsquo;re here at the right time, you might be able to
      watch the pro&rsquo;s as they take on some of the biggest waves in the
      world!</p><ul><li><h3>Explore the streets of Kaka&rsquo;ako
      District</h3></li></ul><p>A street art community project was started by
      Pow Wow Worldwide which showcases the talent of the community. Head to the
      Kaka&rsquo;ako District to check it out!</p><p>It really is incredible to
      see just how creative people are, and how we can express ourselves through
      different forms of art.</p><ul><li><h3>Swim with
      turtles</h3></li></ul><p>We can never get enough of turtles, so we headed
      to Laniakea Beach. There are so many secret spots nearby where
      you&rsquo;ll have the beach to yourself.</p><p>As Marie was gently
      floating in the water, a turtle mistook her bright yellow bathing suit for
      algae and bit her. A moment we won&rsquo;t forget too
      quickly!</p><ul><li><h3>Go beaching at Waimea Bay</h3></li></ul><p>Waimea
      Bay is a beautiful beach on the north shore of Oahu. It&rsquo;s a great
      place to go swimming, snorkeling, and surfing. We even saw an eagle
      ray!</p><p>We met up with Nolan, a local photographer who we&rsquo;ve been
      following for quite some time and it was great getting the chance to meet
      him and create some awesome content together.</p><ul><li><h3>SUP
      Yoga</h3></li></ul><p>Doing yoga is an integral part of our daily routine
      and we were put to the test in Oahu when we did yoga, on a stand-up
      paddleboard, in the middle of the ocean!</p><p>It was a beautiful way to
      take in our first sunset on Oahu Island in Hawaii.</p><p>Our session was
      lead by<a href="https://www.yogafloats.com/"> <u>Yoga Floats</u></a> at
      Waikiki Beach. It cost $40 per person for the 1.5-hour yoga class.</p>

      <h2>Kauai</h2><p>Kauai was the last stop on our Hawaii itinerary. We were
      welcomed to the island with a morning shower but that didn&rsquo;t stop us
      from getting out and exploring!</p><p>Kauai is often overlooked by
      tourists who have limited time and choose to visit other islands, such as
      the Island of Hawaii and Oahu instead. But the secret is out: Kauai is our
      favorite place in Hawaii!</p>

We explored caves, saw countless dolphins and several giant turtles.</p><p>For $130 per person, you&rsquo;ll get 6 hours on the ocean including food, refreshments and snorkeling gear.

    main-paragraph-emphasis: How To Get To Hawaii And Best Time To Visit It
    body-content_html: >-
      <h3>How To Get To Hawaii</h3><p>Most international flights to Hawaii
      arrive at Oahu. To get to the Island of Hawaii and Kauai, you&rsquo;ll
      need to catch a domestic flight from Oahu. Both islands are about 40
      minutes away and a return flight will cost about $145.</p><h3>How To Get
      Around The Islands</h3><p>The Hawaiian Islands are best explored by
      car.</p><p>Renting a vehicle for the duration of your stay will allow you
      to have the flexibility to move around as and when you please. You can
      also explore the islands and enjoy the quiet and hidden parts that not
      many people get to see.</p><p>We paid $120 for a 3-day rental which
      included insurance.</p><h3>The Best Time To Visit Hawaii</h3><p>Hawaii is
      top of most traveler&rsquo;s bucket lists and so the best time to visit is
      between September and November when it&rsquo;s not so busy.</p><p>Peak
      season is December to March, and you&rsquo;ll find that everything will
      cost a bit more during this time.</p>

      <h3>Hawaii Budget</h3><p>Unfortunately, Hawaii is one of the more
      expensive destinations we&rsquo;ve visited, but if you plan your trip in
      advance, you can save quite a bit of money.</p><p>A bottle of water costs
      between $1-4 and a simple lunch at a local cafe will set you back $12-$30
      per person. If you&rsquo;re looking to go on a dinner date with your
      partner, expect to pay $20-$40 per person. This excludes the 15-20% tip
      that is expected.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re traveling on a budget, it&rsquo;s
      best to stay in a self-catering apartment where you can cook your own
      meals as all of those costs add up. We paid $29 for snacks and groceries
      for 3 people to make dinner at our apartment and we highly recommend that
      you look at doing the same.</p><p>Bali and Sri Lanka are far more
      affordable travel destinations. But the Hawaiian Islands are unlike any
      place we&rsquo;ve explored before.</p><p>Our trip to the Island of Hawaii
      and Oahu was organized in collaboration with @gohawaiiuk to raise
      awareness for sustainable tourism. Thank you for having us on your
      beautiful islands and we can&rsquo;t wait to return!</p>
