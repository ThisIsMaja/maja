      <p>The Island of Hawaii is the youngest and largest of all the Hawaiian
      Islands. Nearly twice the size of all the other islands combined, it is
      still growing.</p><p>There are two main cities on the Island of Hawaii -
      Kona is on the West side, and Hilo is on the East. We stayed in Kona,
      which is the more popular of the two, and loved the vibe and energy that
      came along with it.</p><p>The Island of Hawaii exceeded all our
      expectations as every corner brings with it dramatically different
      landscapes and exciting new adventures. From cascading waterfalls, to
      glittering, black sand beaches, scenic hiking routes and majestic
      volcanoes, the Island of Hawaii is an explorers paradise!</p><p>We
      recommend that you spend at least 4 days here. but even longer if you have
      the time!</p>

    main-paragraph-emphasis: Things To Do On The Island Of Hawaii
    body-content_html: >-
      <ul><li><u>Explore Hawaii Volcanoes National Park</u></li></ul><p>One of
      the main attractions on the Island of Hawaii is Hawaii Volcanoes National
      Park, which is easily accessible and a must-visit.</p><p>We spent an
      afternoon exploring here and ended our day by watching the most incredible
      sunset. The sky was bright pink as we stood there, on the rim of the
      crater, with steam rising from the volcano, and mingling with the dusky
      shades of the sky.</p><p>It was a surreal experience and one of those
      &ldquo;pinch me&rdquo; kind of moments.</p><p>Costs to visit Hawaii
      Volcanoes National Park</p><p>We joined<a
      href="https://www.epiclava.com/"> <u>Epic Lava&rsquo;s Volcano Park
      Tour</u></a><u> </u>and met with their team at the Kilauea Visitor
      Center.</p><p>The tour prices start from $125 per person for the 4-hour
      tour, which we highly recommend. Their guides are extremely passionate
      about the island, and the history behind the park.</p><p>If this is out of
      your price range, you can also visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
      independently.</p><p>The entrance fee is only $25 per car which gives you
      access for the whole week.</p><ul><li><u>Go canoeing</u></li></ul><p>After
      arriving on the Island of Hawaii, we were so excited to get out and about!
      We checked into our hotel and headed straight to the beach, got a canoe
      and paddled out into the ocean for sunset.</p><p>You can rent canoes from
      Kona Boys Beach Shack on Kona Beach.</p><ul><li><u>Take part in a Hula
      Class</u></li></ul><p>The hula dance is synonymous with Hawaii but not
      many people know the meaning behind it or get a chance to experience this
      unique dance firsthand.</p><p>The Hula dance expresses the local beliefs
      and their culture, as well as respect for the environment around us.
      Learning more about the Hawaiian culture was a great introduction to our
      stay on the Hawaiian Islands.</p><ul><li><u>Go snorkeling with Manta
      Rays</u></li></ul><p>Snorkeling with Manta Rays at night was a magical
      experience and one of the highlights of our time in Hawaii.</p><p>They are
      huge and may seem quite scary at first, but they&rsquo;re calm, gentle
      giants.</p><p>Our manta experience was organized by<a
      href="https://www.anelakaiadventures.com/"> <u>Anelakaia
      Adventures,</u></a> an eco-friendly tour operator in Hawaii. We ventured
      out from Kona and made our way into the ocean on a canoe with no
      engine.</p><p>Snorkeling at night when you&rsquo;re surrounded by Manta
      Rays can be quite intimidating, but our guide made sure that we were
      relaxed and felt safe before getting in.</p><p>The tour costs $109 per
      person and is worth every penny.</p><ul><li><u>Go for a
      hike</u></li></ul><p>When you&rsquo;re visiting the Island of Hawaii,
      adventure is on your doorstep. And the best way to take it all in is to
      explore on foot. This is exactly what we did when we visited Pololu
      Valley, the northernmost valley of the extinct volcano, Kohala.</p><p>As
      we stood there, high up on the cliffs, we watched the waves as they
      crashed in all their might against the rocks below.</p><p>The Pololu
      Valley hike is towards the North of the island, about 1.5 hours&rsquo;
      drive from Kona. The route is well marked and not crowded. Highly
      recommended!</p><ul><li><u>Visit a black sand beach</u></li></ul><p>Pololu
      Beach is a black sand beach on the northern coast of the Island of Hawaii.
      The bay is surrounded by towering cliffs and is completely
      deserted.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a great outing to pair with the Pololu Valley
      hike above, even in the rain!</p><ul><li><u>Make some delicious Kona
      coffee</u></li></ul><p>We joined<a href="https://www.ucc-hawaii.com/">
      <u>UCC Hawaii</u></a> and got our hands dirty roasting our very own coffee
      in Kona. The team explained the entire coffee-making process and we
      enjoyed a few cups of our freshly roasted coffee after!</p><p>The coffee
      tour costs $45 per person which includes 2 bags of coffee with your own
      custom label.</p><ul><li><u>Check out the largest waterfall in
      Hawaii</u></li></ul><p>At 135m high, Akaka Waterfall is Hawaii&rsquo;s
      largest waterfall and one of the best places to visit on the Island of
      Hawaii.</p><p>It&rsquo;s located east of the island, close to Hilo. The
      waterfall is a short walk from the parking lot and entrance is $5 per
      car.</p>

      <p><u>Where To Eat On The Island Of Hawaii</u></p><p>We were so impressed
      with all the vegan options available and highly recommend the below
      restaurants on the Island of Hawaii.</p><ul><li>Sweet Potato
      Kitchen</li><li>Pōmaikaʻi Cafe</li><li>Sweet Cane

      Hawaii</u></p><ul><li>Luxury:<a
      href="https://www.fairmont.com/orchid-hawaii/"> <u>Fairmont Orchid</u></a>
      - This luxurious resort is the perfect place to return to after a full day
      of exploring. They also have kayaks, SUP&rsquo;s and snorkeling equipment
      which you can use and there are turtles right on the beach in front of the

      we&rsquo;re traveling. Not only are they cheaper than hotels, but you can
      also prepare your own meals so you save costs by not eating out. Places
