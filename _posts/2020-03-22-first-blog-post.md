  <p>Most of us live our lives according to some form of daily routine. It can
  be a conscious routine that helps you bring structure to your day (wake up,
  exercise, work) or an unconscious one where you still perform the same tasks
  but not necessarily always in the same order. The thing about routines is that
  they create a comfort zone that can stop us from challenging ourselves. They
  can dull our senses even if they are meant to do good. So how do you get out
  of this rut without losing the beneficial structure a daily routine can give
  you?</p><p>The answer is easy: creativity.</p>

      Creativity allows us to be more innovative and can subconsciously help us
      to come up with fresh ideas

      <p>And before you start debating that you are not a creative person,
      creativity does not necessarily mean you have to be an artist, musician or
      poet to allow it into your life. Everyone has a sense of creative energy,
      and if you allow yourself to tap into it using creative activities, it can
      improve your day, your thought process and even help you to relieve stress
      and anxiety.</p><p>Here are some easy tips to bring more creativity into
      your daily routine:</p><ul><li><strong>Wake up early</strong>&nbsp;and
      channel that first subconscious stream of thoughts and energy into
      something creative. This can be journaling, where you just write whatever
      pops into your mind, drawing or colouring what you feel or even applying
      it to a new exercise routine, like trying a creative yoga
      flow</li><li><strong>Listen to music</strong>&nbsp;to experience a
      transfer of creativity. There&rsquo;s nothing like the power of music to
      get you excited for the day, and even better if you are allowed to listen
      to music at work</li><li><strong>Be mindful of the small
      things</strong>&nbsp;that you enjoy and make it a little creative ritual.
      Put some love into that first cup of coffee, savour it and enjoy
      it</li><li><strong>Be creative in everyday tasks</strong>&nbsp;like
      cooking and gardening. These don&rsquo;t have to be chores, let your
      imagination run wild and experiment with new
      ingredients</li><li><strong>Set a creative goal</strong>&nbsp;if you would
      like to learn a skill like painting, pottery, etc. and make time to join a
      class</li><li><strong>Remove negative thoughts&nbsp;</strong>about your
      creativity as this will just block your creative energies. Meditation and
      mindfulness practice can be a great help in releasing negative
      thoughts</li></ul><p>Creativity allows us to be more innovative and can
      subconsciously help us to come up with fresh ideas and to balance out a
      rigid daily routine. Once you start sprinkling your daily routine with
      creativity you will realise that you won&rsquo;t be able to live without
      it.</p>
