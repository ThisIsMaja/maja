  <p>Egypt is a fascinating country with an incredibly rich history, you
  probably already knew that. But do you know whether it is safe, or how to get
  around, or which landmarks are especially worth seeing? If the answer is no
  then read on.</p><p>We flew into Egypt at 02:00 am, we were tired but excited
  and not really sure what to expect. We had a friend pick us up from the
  airport who we coincidentally met in the Philippines back in 2017. Our account
  of Cairo may well be different to others as we were lucky enough to have a
  friend as a local guide.</p><p>We went straight to a local restaurant that was
  still open at 03:00 am and proceeded to eat one of the best plant-based local
  meals we have ever had. This is was just the start of an epic 3 week Egypt
  adventure.</p>

      <h2>How to get around</h2><p>After doing a fair bit of research we decided
      that travelling around Egypt and making the most of our time there was
      best done on an organised tour. We found a company called Travel Talk that
      did&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.traveltalktours.com/destinations/egypt-tours/"><u>15 day
      Egypt and Jordan tours</u></a>&nbsp;for a great price so we booked for the
      last two weeks of our time in Egypt. In our honest opinion looking back at
      our trip we feel like this was the best option!&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of the
      main attractions in Egypt are spread out over hundreds of kilometres with
      a lot of nothingness in between. Having an organised tour meant that we
      could relax on the bus and take it easy in between the rush of visiting
      each attraction. Egypt can be quite hectic at times albeit incredible so
      taking some of the stress out of your trip is definitely a good thing.
      Along with this comes the added peace of mind that you are safer being
      with a group. We don&rsquo;t necessarily think Egypt is unsafe but
      especially for girls, it can be uncomfortable as the locals don&rsquo;t
      have the same manners we do.</p><p>Being on a tour also meant that we had
      a guide. This was really great, we learnt so much about the fascinating
      history of Egypt while on our tour and it really gave the whole experience
      a deeper meaning for us. It also meant that we could skip the lines at
      places like King Tut&rsquo;s Tomb, Karnak Temple, Abu Simbel
      etc.</p><p>There are many local buses also that you can use to get around
      which we actually used to get to Marsa Alam. Along the 12 hour trip, we
      passed around 6-7 checkpoints where we had to show our passports, this
      would have been ok if it wasn&rsquo;t in the middle of the night. This is
      a precautionary safety measure which is obviously a good thing in general
      to have.</p>

      <h2>Plant-based food in Egypt</h2><p>We were actually really surprised by
      the food in Egypt. It can be especially hard for us to find good food when
      we travel considering the fact we are plant-based, although in Egypt this
      was not the case.</p><p>Fruit for our morning breakfasts was hard to come
      by at times and there is an abundance of unhealthy packaged food, but for
      the most part, there are really good options for all us Vegans/Plant-based
      people!!</p><h3>Food to try in Egypt</h3><ul><li>Koshari (good for carb
      loading and especially good if you are hungry after a long day of
      exploring) made of rice, macaroni, and lentils mixed together, topped with
      a spiced tomato sauce and garlic vinegar, and garnished with chickpeas and
      crispy fried onions. Sprinklings of garlic juice, garlic vinegar, and hot
      sauce are optional</li><li>Mulukhiyah (a braised greens dish made with
      jute leaf, that's delicious and good for you)</li><li>Falafel (a
      deep-fried ball, or a flat or doughnut-shaped patty, made from ground
      chickpeas, fava beans, or both. Herbs, spices, and onion relatives are
      commonly added to the dough)</li></ul><h3>Places to eat in Egypt</h3><p>We
      only have one suggestion for you on where to eat, we ate at so many
      different restaurants and they were, for the most part, all good. But this
      cafe was the perfect touch we needed to finish our time in
      Cairo!</p><ul><li>Sea Salt Bakery and Cafe in Cairo</li></ul>

      <h2>Marsa Alam 2-3 days</h2><p>First, we wanted to do a little bit of
      exploring ourselves, we had heard of a place on the Red Sea called Marsa
      Alam that had great diving and dolphins!! This was a must for us, so we
      jumped on a local bus from Cairo to Marsa Alam and 12 hours later we
      arrived.</p><p>Swimming with the Dolphins in Marsa Alam was an experience
      we did not expect when we planned out our trip to Egypt and was definitely
      the highlight of our trip. The tented beachside village we stayed at
      called Marsa Shagra was definitely our favourite accommodation of the
      entire trip. Although we didn&rsquo;t venture much into the actual town of
      Marsa Alam we spent some time exploring the picturesque deserted
      coastline. We absolutely loved it and took some great photos.</p><p>We
      only stayed and ate at one place. It was awesome!</p><p>Stay, eat and
      organise dolphin tour + Diving</p><p>- <a

      <p>For the rest of our trip throughout Egypt, we booked an organised tour.
      We highly recommend the organised tour experience, we found Travel Talk
      Tours to be the best value for money and their tours were also tailored to
      younger travellers (18-35 range)</p><p>Without further ado, let&rsquo;s
      get into what we covered over the tour followed up with some of our
      favourite photos.</p><h3>Day 1: Cairo</h3><p>Meet and greet with our
      group, get to know everybody, go through the tour schedule</p><h3>Day 2:
      Cairo city tour, Luxor</h3><p>First sighting of the great pyramids of Giza
      (it was absolutely mind-blowing seeing these for the first time.
      Definitely childhood dreams)</p><h3>Day 3: Luxor, Aswan</h3><p>Visiting
      Karnak temple, one of the most important religious centres of ancient
      Egypt. (We took some incredible photos here at sunrise, we asked our guide
      if we could leave early and catch our own taxi to get the right light and
      beat the crowds)</p><h3>Day 4-5: Aswan, felucca cruise, Abu
      Simbel</h3><p>A huge day of sightseeing starting out with a 4 am wake up
      to drive to Abu Simbel (Definitely worth the early wake-up and the
      2.5-hour bus ride). Followed by a visit to Philae temple which is located
      on a small island in the middle of the Nile. In the afternoon the groups
      jump onboard the traditional Felucca&rsquo;s and sail off into the sunset
      down the Nile where they will spend the night.</p><h3>Day 6: Edfu,
      Komombo, Luxor</h3><p>The temples don&rsquo;t end there, day 6 is full of
      more extremely impressive temples built over centuries to honour the
      gods.</p><h3>Day 7: Valley of the kings</h3><p>On this morning we rose
      again early to take a hot air balloon over Luxor for sunrise (THIS WAS
      EPIC) The next discovery is the magnificent &ldquo;city of the Dead&rdquo;
      where tombs were carved into the desert rocks, decorated richly, and
      filled with treasures for the Pharaoh afterlife.</p><h3>Day 8:
      Cairo</h3><p>After arriving back in Cairo we did a tour of the famous
      Cairo Museum.</p><h3>Day 9-11: Dahab</h3><p>To finish off the Egypt
      adventure we headed for the coastal town of Dahab which was a great way to
      finish the tour. By this time you will most likely be &lsquo;templed
      out&rsquo; so some time spent at the beach swimming in the crystal clear
      water is perfectly refreshing.</p>
