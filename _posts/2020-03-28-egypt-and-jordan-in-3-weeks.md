intro-paragraph-emphasis: 'How, what and where in Egypt'
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>Egypt is a fascinating country with incredibly rich history, you probably
  already knew that. But do you know whether it is safe, or how to get around,
  or which landmarks are especially worth seeing? If the answer is no then read
  on.&nbsp;</p><p>We flew into Egypt at 02:00am, we were tired but excited and
  not really sure what to expect. We had a friend pick us up from the airport
  who we coincidentally met in the Philippines back in 2017. Our account of
  Cairo may well be different to others as we were lucky enough to have a friend
  as a local guide.</p><p>We went straight to a local restaurant that was still
  open at 03:00am and proceeded to eat one of the best plant based local meals
  we have ever had. This is was just the start of an epic 3 week Egypt/Jordan
  adventure.</p>

  Swimming with the Dolphins in Marsa Alam was an experience we did not expect
  when we planned out our trip to Egypt

  <p>After doing a fair bit of research we decided that travelling around Egypt
  and making the most of our time there was best done on an organised tour. We
  found a company called Travel Talk that did&nbsp;<a
  href="https://www.traveltalktours.com/destinations/egypt-tours/">15 day Egypt
  and Jordan tours&nbsp;</a>for a great price so we booked for the last two
  weeks of our time in Egypt. In our honest opinion looking back at our trip we
  feel like this was the best option! Alot of the main attractions in Egypt are
  spread out over hundreds of kilometres with alot of nothingness in between.
  Having an organised tour meant that we could relax on the bus and take it easy
  in between the rush of visiting each attraction. Egypt can be quite hectic at
  times albeit incredible so taking some of the stress out of your trip is
  definitely a good thing. Along with this comes the added piece of mind that
  you are safer being with a group. We dont necessarily think Egypt is unsafe
  but especially for girls it can be uncomfortable as the locals dont have the
  same manners we do.&nbsp;</p><p>Being on a tour also meant that we had a
  guide. This was really great, we learnt so much about the fascinating history
  of Egypt while on our tour and it really gave the whole experience a deeper
  meaning for us. It also meant that we could skip the lines at places like King
  Tut&rsquo;s Tomb, Karnak Temple, Abu Simbel etc.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many
  local buses also that you can use to get around which we actually used to get
  to Marsa Alam. Along the 12 hour trip we passed around 6-7 checkpoints where
  we had to show our passports, this would have been ok if it wasnt in the
  middle of the night. This is a precautionary safety measure which is obviously
  a good thing in general to have.&nbsp;</p><h4>plant based food in
  egypt</h4><p>We were actually really surprised by the food in Egypt. It can be
  especially hard for us to find good food when we travel considering the fact
  we are plant based, although in Egypt this was not the case.&nbsp;</p><p>Fruit
  for our morning breakfasts was hard to come by at times and there is an
  abundance of unhealthy packaged food, but for the most part there are really
  good options for all us Vegans/Plant based people!!</p><h4>Food to try in
  egypt</h4><ul><li>Koshari (good for carb loading and especially good if you
  are hungry after a long day of exploring) made of rice, macaroni, and lentils
  mixed together, topped with a spiced tomato sauce and garlic vinegar, and
  garnished with chickpeas and crispy fried onions. Sprinklings of garlic juice,
  garlic vinegar, and hot sauce are optional</li><li>Mulukhiyah (a braised
  greens dish made with jute leaf, that's delicious and good for
  you)</li><li>Falafel (a deep-fried ball, or a flat or doughnut-shaped patty,
  made from ground chickpeas, fava beans, or both. Herbs, spices, and onion
  relatives are commonly added to the dough)</li></ul><h4>Places to
  eat</h4><p>We only have one suggestion for you on where to eat, we ate at so
  many different restaurants and they were for the most part all good. But this
  cafe was the perfect touch we needed to finish our time in
  Cairo!</p><ul><li>Sea Salt Bakery and Cafe in Cairo</li></ul><h3>Marsa Alam
  2-3 days</h3><p>First we wanted to do a little bit of exploring ourselves, we
  had heard of a place on the Red Sea called Marsa Alam that had great diving
  and dolphins!! This was a must for us, so we jumped on a local bus from Cairo
  to Marsa Alam and 12 hours later we arrived.</p><p>Swimming with the Dolphins
  in Marsa Alam was an experience we did not expect when we planned out our trip
  to Egypt and was definitely the highlight of our trip. The tented beach side
  village we stayed at called Marsa Shagra was definitely our favourite
  accomodation of the entire trip. Although we didnt venture much into the
  actual town of Marsa Alam we spent some time exploring the picturesque
  deserted coastline. We absolutely loved it and took some great
  photos.&nbsp;</p><p>We only stayed and ate at one place, It was
  awesome!</p><h3>Stay, eat and organise dolphin tour + Diving</h3><p>- &nbsp;<a
  href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/eg/marsa-shagra-village.en.html?aid=1556632&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Marsa
  Shagra Village</a></p><h2>Travel Talk Tour, Egypt Leg (11 days)</h2><p>For the
  rest of our trip throughout Egypt we booked an organised tour. We highly
  recommend the organised tour experience, we found Travel Talk Tours to be the
  best value for money and their tours were also tailored to younger travellers
  (18-35 range)</p><p>Without further ado lets get into what we covered over the
  tour followed up with some of our favourite photos.</p><h4>day 1:
  cairo</h4><p>Meet and greet with our group, get to know everybody, go through
  the tour schedule</p><h4>day 2: cairo city tour, luxor</h4><p>First sighting
  of the great pyramids of Giza (it was absolutely mind blowing seeing these for
  the first time. Definitely childhood dreams)</p><h4>day 3: luxor,
  aswan</h4><p>Visiting Karnak temple, one of the most important religious
  centres of ancient Egypt. (We took some incredible photos here at sunrise, we
  asked our guide if we could leave early and catch our own taxi to get the
  right light and beat the crowds)</p><h4>day 4-5: aswan, felucca cruise, abu
  simbel</h4><p>Huge day of sight seeing starting out with a 4am wake up to
  drive to Abu Simbel (Definitely worth the early wake up and the 2.5 hour bus
  ride) Followed by a visit to Philae temple which is located on a small island
  in the middle of the Nile. In the afternoon the groups jump onboard the
  traditional Felucca&rsquo;s and sail off into the sunset down the Nile where
  they will spend the night.</p><h4>day 6: edfu, komombo, luxor</h4><p>The
  temples dont end there, day 6 is full of more extremely impressive temples
  built over centuries to honour the gods.</p><h4>day 7: valley of the
  kings</h4><p>On this morning we rose again early to take a hot air balloon
  over Luxor for sunrise (THIS WAS EPIC) The next discovery is the magnificent
  &ldquo;city of the Dead&rdquo; where tombs were carved into the desert rocks,
  decorated richly, and filled with treasures for the Pharaoh
  afterlife.</p><h4>day 8: cairo</h4><p>After arriving back in Cairo we did a
  tour of the famous Cairo museum.</p><h4>day 9-11: dahab</h4><p>To finish off
  the Egypt adventure we headed for the coastal town of Dahab which was a great
  way to finish the tour. By this time you will most likely be &lsquo;templed
  out&rsquo; so some time spent at the beach swimming in the crystal clear water
  is perfectly refreshing.</p><h2>Our Egypt Highlights</h2><p>We really enjoyed
  visiting every temple and attraction in Egypt on our tour but there were
  definitely spots that left a bigger impression on us than others.</p><p>Our
  must sees and do&rsquo;s in Egypt are:</p><ul><li>Karnak
  Temple</li><li>Pyramids of Giza</li><li>Abu Simbel</li><li>Hot air balloon
  over Luxor</li><li>Snorkelling in Dahab</li><li>Diving in Marsa
  Alam</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>On to Jordan (4 days)</h1><p>Although we didnt
  have much time left to explore the surrounding countries of Egypt we
  definitely wanted to get a taste of Jordan before flying back to Germany for a
  family gathering. Thankfully Travel Talk offered an extra 4 day leg which
  would extend our tour through Jordan.</p><p>We are soo grateful we decided to
  visit Jordan even though we would have loved to stayed longer. Here is an
  overview of how we spent our short time in Jordan and our highlights of the
  trip.</p><h2>day 1: wadi rum</h2><p>Spending our first night under the stars
  in Jordan was magnificent. We actually arrived by very at night and took a bus
  into our camp also at night. We had no idea of the landscape that surrounded
  us until we woke up the next morning. What we witnessed that morning was
  something we will always remember and one of the best shoots weve ever had
  (Wadi Rum desert is a must see)</p><h2>day 2: wadi rum jeep tour + afternoon
  in petra</h2><p>Following our amazing sunrise shoot we made our way to the
  Wadi Rum visitors centre to start our Jeep Safari. This experience was also
  awesome! It honestly felt like we were in a movie like star wars, or Indiana
  Jones. We didnt ride any camels as dont like to use animals in any way
  including entertainment. However we like taking photos with camels which you
  can see below :)</p><p>Arriving to Petra in the afternoon we made our way
  straight to the famous Red Rose City. We will never forget that feeling of
  walking through the gorge as it opens up to reveal the treasury, this was most
  definitely a once in a lifetime experience and something we recommend for
  everyone.</p><h2>day 3: early morning in petra + dead sea</h2><p>The day
  before we made our plans, we looked at all the places we wanted to shoot and
  now it was time to get the shots. We were the first ones in line at 6.45am to
  make the walk down the gorge to the treasury. We were the first ones there and
  although the lighting wasnt perfect it was great that we could shoot before
  the crowds arrived. We highly recommened going early if you want to take
  photos without alot of people in the way.</p><p>Maybe the biggest disappopint
  for us was the location we got dropped off at to see the Dead Sea. We were
  hoping for white salt beds with shades of pink and a calm lake but we didnt
  get any of that. It wasnt necessarily anyones fault it was just that the
  weather conditions didnt allow for us to visit a nicer part of the lake due to
  risk of flooding. Swimming in the Dead Sea was definitely a surreal experience
  and something we think you should definitely try.</p><h2>day 4:
  amman</h2><p>Our last day in Jordan was spent in the capital city of Amman. We
  visited the citadel which was quite nice and a good spot for photos at
  sunset!</p><h1>Our Last Thoughts</h1><p>Our time in and Egypt and Jordan was
  definitely a fascinating experience, it was crazy and it was full on. In our
  opinion we would do it the same way over again if we could turn back time.
  These two countries are not easy to travel, especially Egypt. We usually
  advocate a more do it yourself approach when it comes to travel as thats the
  way we like to travel and generally the best way to get a raw and real
  experience of a country. But for this trip we really believe a tour is your
  best bet to make the most out of your time.</p><p>In summary we wish we could
  have spent a few more days in Jordan to really capture its beauty, but it is a
  small country and you can cover it pretty quickly. This is a trip for those
  people seeking real adventure, it was not the most comfortable trip but in
  terms of amazement, this trip is up there with the most amazing trips weve
  been on. Our memories of this trip will be of the history, the incredible
  rugged landscapes, the crystal clear Red Sea, camels, pharoahs, pyramids and
  Indiana Jones.</p><p>Have you been to Egypt or Jordan? We would love to know
  about your experience in the comments below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
