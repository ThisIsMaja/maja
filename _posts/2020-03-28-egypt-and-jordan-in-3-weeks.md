  <p>Egypt is a fascinating country with incredibly rich history, you probably
  already knew that. But do you know whether it is safe, or how to get around,
  or which landmarks are especially worth seeing? If the answer is no then read
  on.&nbsp;</p><p>We flew into Egypt at 02:00am, we were tired but excited and
  not really sure what to expect. We had a friend pick us up from the airport
  who we coincidentally met in the Philippines back in 2017. Our account of
  Cairo may well be different to others as we were lucky enough to have a friend
  as a local guide.</p><p>We went straight to a local restaurant that was still
  open at 03:00am and proceeded to eat one of the best plant based local meals
  we have ever had. This is was just the start of an epic 3 week Egypt/Jordan
  adventure.</p>
