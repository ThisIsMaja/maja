  Whilst the Maldives is the ideal honeymoon destination, itâ€™s also the perfect
  place for any type of traveler.

  <p>Over-water bungalows and private villas have become synonymous with the
  Maldives. As a result, many people steer clear of this tropical island
  destination due to budget reasons.</p><p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking for
  adventure, water sports, or a relaxing beach vacation on a budget, the
  Maldives has a bit of something for everyone!</p>

      <h3>How To Get To The Maldives</h3><p>The gateway to the Maldives is
      Velana International Airport on Male Island. The Maldives is a visa-free
      destination and you&rsquo;re able to explore the islands for up to 30
      days.</p><h3>The Best Time To Visit The Maldives</h3><p>The best time to
      visit the Maldives is from December to April. Whilst the weather is
      perfect during this time, it&rsquo;s also the busiest season to visit so
      expect crowds and higher prices all round.</p><p>May to October is
      considered the rainy season but with this comes more affordable
      accommodation options. If you're looking for surf, this is also the best
      time to visit as the swell is biggest during the rainy season.</p><p>Last
      year (2018) we visited the Maldives in August for 6 days and it rained for
      5. It was still lovely and we had a great time, just be aware of this if
      you want so spend some time in the sun.</p><p>In 2019, we traveled to the
      Maldives during November and only had one day of rain, which we welcomed
      after spending a week soaking up the sun. The shoulder seasons are the
      best time to plan your getaway as the islands aren&rsquo;t as busy.</p>

      <h3>Best local islands in the Maldives</h3><p>3 or so years ago, the
      government allowed the local islands in the Maldives to open guest houses
      and hotels. Since then, there&rsquo;s been a surge of budget travelers
      visiting.</p><p>We love that these small businesses can operate and create
      work opportunities for people living on those islands, whilst also
      allowing budget travelers to experience just how amazing the Maldives
      is.</p><p>Below we&rsquo;ve covered 3 local islands in the Maldives:
      Thulusdhoo, Dhigurah, and Goidhoo.</p><p>When planning your trip,
      it&rsquo;s best to stick to 2 or 3 local islands as the fast boats getting
      to and from them can be quite costly. We have tons of behind-the-scenes
      stories on our&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17866901527518257/"><u>Instagram
      highlights</u></a>&nbsp;so check those out!</p><p>If you&rsquo;re
      traveling on a budget, but still want a taste of that luxury Maldives
      lifestyle, you can check out the resorts close to the local islands. Often
      these luxury resorts allow for day visitors to enjoy their facilities and
      restaurants. There are costs involved for this, but it&rsquo;s way more
      affordable than staying at the resort itself.</p>

      <h3>Thulusdhoo Island</h3><p>Thulusdhoo was the first stop of our Maldives
      island hopping adventure and it didn&rsquo;t disappoint!</p><p>To get to
      Thulusdoo, you need to take a 30-minute boat ride from the capital city of
      Male. This one-way trip costs $30 per person.</p><p>Thulusdhoo is one of
      the closest budget islands to Male, and so it&rsquo;s the most popular of
      the 3 local islands in the Maldives. There are over 20 guest houses on the
      island, with prices starting from $65 per room per night.</p><p>After
      arriving in Thulusdhoo, you&rsquo;ll notice the quiet, sandy streets and
      the beautiful white powdery beach that steals the show!</p><h4>Things to
      do in Thulusdhoo</h4><p>Thulusdhoo is an adventure playground as there are
      so many exciting water-sports available including skiing or wake boarding.
      Scuba diving is also a popular activity here and there are 2 dive shops on
      the island.</p><p>The surf breaks near Thulusdhoo attract scores of
      surfers and are considered the best places to surf in the Maldives. These
      include &ldquo;Cokes&rdquo; which is a fast right-hander and
      &ldquo;Chicken&rsquo;s&rdquo; which is a long peeling left.</p><p>The best
      way to explore Thulusdhoo is to go out on a boat for the day ($100) and
      visit the nearby snorkeling sites and sandbars. If you split this cost
      between 6 people, as we did, it really is affordable.</p><p>One of our
      highlights was free-diving in Thulusdhoo. Although the visibility
      wasn&rsquo;t great at the time, we were lucky enough to swim with both
      turtles and dolphins. Eagle Rays are also common sightings in the
      area.</p><p>After long days out on the ocean, we ended off with beach
      yoga. We highly recommend this, not only for your well-being but also to
      enjoy the pristine beaches, quiet surroundings, and gorgeous
      sunset.</p><h4>Where To Stay In Thulusdhoo</h4><ul><li>Season Paradise:
      $90 per room per night, including breakfast</li></ul>
