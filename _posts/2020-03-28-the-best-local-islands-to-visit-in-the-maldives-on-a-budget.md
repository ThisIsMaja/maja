  place for any type of traveler.

  <p>Over-water bungalows and private villas have become synonymous with the
  Maldives. As a result, many people steer clear of this tropical island
  destination due to budget reasons.</p><p>But, whilst the Maldives is the ideal
  honeymoon destination, it&rsquo;s also the perfect place for any type of
  traveler. The local islands in the Maldives are yours to
  explore!</p><p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking for adventure, water sports, or a
  relaxing beach vacation on a budget, the Maldives has a bit of something for
  everyone!</p>
main-paragraph-emphasis: Soneva is unlike any luxury resort we’ve visited - ever!

  <h2>how to get to the maldives</h2><p>The gateway to the Maldives is Velana
  International Airport on Male Island. The Maldives is a visa-free destination
  and you&rsquo;re able to explore the islands for up to 30 days.</p><h2>the
  best time to visit the maldives</h2><p>The best time to visit the Maldives is
  from December to April. Whilst the weather is perfect during this time,
  it&rsquo;s also the busiest season to visit so expect crowds and higher prices
  all round.</p><p>May to October is considered the rainy season but with this
  comes more affordable accommodation options. If you're looking for surf, this
  is also the best time to visit as the swell is biggest during the rainy
  season.</p><p>Last year (2018) we visited the Maldives in August for 6 days
  and it rained for 5. It was still lovely and we had a great time, just be
  aware of this if you want so spend some time in the sun.</p><p>In 2019, we
  traveled to the Maldives during November and only had one day of rain, which
  we welcomed after spending a week soaking up the sun. The shoulder seasons are
  the best time to plan your getaway as the islands aren&rsquo;t as
  busy.</p><h2>best local islands in the maldives</h2><p>3 or so years ago, the
  government allowed the local islands in the Maldives to open guest houses and
  hotels. Since then, there&rsquo;s been a surge of budget travelers
  visiting.</p><p>We love that these small businesses can operate and create
  work opportunities for people living on those islands, whilst also allowing
  budget travelers to experience just how amazing the Maldives is.</p><p>Below
  we&rsquo;ve covered 3 local islands in the Maldives: Thulusdhoo, Dhigurah, and
  Goidhoo.</p><p>When planning your trip, it&rsquo;s best to stick to 2 or 3
  local islands as the fast boats getting to and from them can be quite costly.
  We have tons of behind-the-scenes stories on our <a
  href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17866901527518257/">Instagram
  highlights </a>so check those out!</p><p>If you&rsquo;re traveling on a
  budget, but still want a taste of that luxury Maldives lifestyle, you can
  check out the resorts close to the local islands. Often these luxury resorts
  allow for day visitors to enjoy their facilities and restaurants. There are
  costs involved for this, but it&rsquo;s way more affordable than staying at
  the resort itself.</p><h2>3 of the best local islands in the
  maldives</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>thulusdhoo</h2><p>Thulusdhoo was the first
  stop of our Maldives island hopping adventure and it didn&rsquo;t
  disappoint!</p><p>To get to Thulusdoo, you need to take a 30-minute boat ride
  from the capital city of Male. This one-way trip costs $30 per
  person.</p><p>Thulusdhoo is one of the closest budget islands to Male, and so
  it&rsquo;s the most popular of the 3 local islands in the Maldives. There are
  over 20 guest houses on the island, with prices starting from $65 per room per
  night.</p><p>After arriving in Thulusdhoo, you&rsquo;ll notice the quiet,
  sandy streets and the beautiful white powdery beach that steals the
  show!</p><h3>Things to do in Thulusdhoo</h3><p>Thulusdhoo is an adventure
  playground as there are so many exciting water-sports available including
  skiing or wake boarding. Scuba diving is also a popular activity here and
  there are 2 dive shops on the island.</p><p>The surf breaks near Thulusdhoo
  attract scores of surfers and are considered the best places to surf in the
  Maldives. These include &ldquo;Cokes&rdquo; which is a fast right-hander and
  &ldquo;Chicken&rsquo;s&rdquo; which is a long peeling left.</p><p>The best way
  to explore Thulusdhoo is to go out on a boat for the day ($100) and visit the
  nearby snorkeling sites and sandbars. If you split this cost between 6 people,
  as we did, it really is affordable.</p><p>One of our highlights was freediving
  in Thulusdhoo. Although the visibility wasn&rsquo;t great at the time, we were
  lucky enough to swim with both turtles and dolphins. Eagle Rays are also
  common sightings in the area.</p><p>After long days out on the ocean, we ended
  off with beach yoga. We highly recommend this, not only for your well-being
  but also to enjoy the pristine beaches, quiet surroundings, and gorgeous
  sunset.</p><h3>Where to stay in Thulusdhoo</h3><ul><li>Season Paradise: $90
  per room per night, including breakfast<h2>&nbsp;</h2></li></ul><h2>dhigurah
  island</h2><p>Dhigurah Island is further north of Thulusdhoo and translated
  directly, means &ldquo;long island&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s only 3km long and 250m
  wide!We loved Dhigurah island! It&rsquo;s the epitome of simple island life
  with gorgeous sunsets and secluded beaches.It&rsquo;s a paradise island and is
  regarded as one of the most beautiful places in the Maldives. The best part?
  You can visit Dhigurah Island on a budget.But, because of its remote location,
  Dhigurah Island is slightly more expensive than the other local islands in the
  Maldives, with accommodation staring at around $90 per room.To get to Dhigurah
  from Thulusdhoo, you need to go back to Male. You then hop on another
  speedboat which will take 2 hours to get to Dhigurah and costs $55 per person.
  Alternatively, you could fly from Male to Dhigurah but this costs $270 for the
  round trip.</p><h3>Things to do in Dhigurah Island</h3><p>As with all local
  islands in the Maldives, the main attractions lie beyond the seashore.Dhigurah
  Island is the only area in the Maldives where whale sharks and manta rays are
  spotted all year round.Learning about the whale sharks was one of our
  highlights on Dhigurah Island. These gentle giants move through this area
  naturally, and it isn&rsquo;t a tourist trap (like we&rsquo;ve experienced
  elsewhere)When whale sharks move towards the surface, they&rsquo;re coming to
  regulate their temperature. Make sure you stay at least 3m away from them and
  don&rsquo;t stress out. They are huge, but they are also harmless!There are
  amazing scuba diving sites here where it&rsquo;s highly likely that
  you&rsquo;ll swim with sharks and other beautiful marine life.</p><h3>Where to
  stay in Dhigurah</h3><p>Bliss Dhigurah: $100 per night for a double room which
  includes breakfast.</p><h2>goidhoo island</h2><p>Goidhoo is the smallest of
  the 3 local islands we visited. Not many people live here and there are only 2
  guesthouses on the island.If you&rsquo;re looking for seclusion and
  tranquility, this is the best local island to visit in the Maldives!To get to
  Goidhoo Island, you need to take a speed boat from the main island, Male. This
  is under 2 hours and costs $80 for the return trip.</p><h3>Things to do in
  Goidhoo Island</h3><p>Take the cruiser bikes from Olive Giodhoo and explore
  the peaceful island. You will find a beautiful white beach at the far end of
  the island about a 10-minute ride from town. Spend the day relaxing and
  enjoying the calming nature of Giodhoo. We also went out on a catamaran and
  explored the surrounding islands including Fulhadhoo Island which is just
  15-minutes away from Goidhoo. If you have the chance, pack some snacks, park
  off at one of the sandbars and spend your afternoon lazing in the sun and
  freediving just off the beach.The best way to explore Goidhoo Island itself is
  by bike as it&rsquo;s the only way to get around.</p><h3>Where to stay in
  Goidhoo Island</h3><p>Olive Goidhoo: $70 a night for a double room including
  breakfast</p><h2>luxury resorts in the maldives for the perfect
  honeymoon</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re planning a luxurious honeymoon, Maldives is
  the place to go! You can also spend most of your time on the local islands and
  treat yourselves to one or two nights at the below resorts before you head
  back home.</p><h2>amilla fushi</h2><p>After spending 9 days exploring local
  islands in the Maldives, we headed to Amilla Fushi, a gorgeous resort
  surrounded by crystal clear water.The name &ldquo;Amilla Fushi&rdquo;
  translates to &ldquo;My Island Home&rdquo; and it sure lives up to this!Amilla
  Fushi has everything you want, and more: A private villa with an infinity pool
  and a beautiful hammock perched in the ocean. Not to mention the spacious room
  and outdoor shower! The waters surrounding Amilla Fushi are home to hundreds
  of Manta Rays and Sting Rays. This is the biggest attraction here and an
  experience we&rsquo;ll never forget.As we hopped into the water, a huge
  squadron of manta rays swam past us - this moment was surreal!We loved our
  time here. From jet skiing to exploring the underwater world on a sea bob, to
  afternoon swims in the rain, Amilla Fushi is an incredible place to visit if
  your budget allows for it!</p><h2>soneva</h2><p>Soneva is unlike any luxury
  resort we&rsquo;ve visited - ever! It&rsquo;s more famously known for its
  water slide but there&rsquo;s so much more to love about Soneva.The beautiful,
  minimalist wooden villas have thatched roofs as sustainability is one of the
  main focuses here.There&rsquo;s a vegetable garden on the property and most
  produce from here is used in the kitchen (which serves the most delicious,
  tasty vegan food we&rsquo;ve ever had!)Soneva recycles and reuses 90% of
  everything from food to plastic and glass. Their focus is on a SLOW life -
  Sustainable, local, organic, wellness. We love this mission and it was great
  to go behind the scenes and see how Soneva is bringing their vision to
  life.</p><h2>tips for visiting local islands in the maldives (or luxury
  resorts)</h2><ul><li>If you&rsquo;re looking for the best vegan food in the
  Maldives, make sure you pop into Shell Beans on the main island of
  Male.</li><li>There are small supermarkets on all the local islands in the
  Maldives where you can buy snacks, water, and fruit.</li><li>Each of the local
  islands have cafes where you&rsquo;ll pay between $5-$15 per
  meal.&nbsp;</li><li>Most guesthouses offer half-board and full-board options
  so be sure to inquire about this before you make your reservation. The full
  board option is approximately and an additional $30 per person per
  day.</li><li>After landing at the airport on Male Island, it&rsquo;s best to
  buy a sim card. This cost us $30 for 17gigs of data.</li><li>When snorkeling
  or diving, please don&rsquo;t touch or stand on coral. We see this happening
  too often and coral is destroyed by these reckless actions.</li><li>Wear reef
  free sunscreen as chemicals from normal sunscreens are harmful to the
  underwater ecosystem.</li></ul><p><a target="_blank"
