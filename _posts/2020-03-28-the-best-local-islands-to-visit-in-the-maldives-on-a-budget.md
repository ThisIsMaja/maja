  Whilst the Maldives is the ideal honeymoon destination, itâ€™s also the perfect
  place for any type of traveler.

  <p>Over-water bungalows and private villas have become synonymous with the
  Maldives. As a result, many people steer clear of this tropical island
  destination due to budget reasons.</p><p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking for
  adventure, water sports, or a relaxing beach vacation on a budget, the
  Maldives has a bit of something for everyone!</p>

      <h3>How To Get To The Maldives</h3><p>The gateway to the Maldives is
      Velana International Airport on Male Island. The Maldives is a visa-free
      destination and you&rsquo;re able to explore the islands for up to 30
      days.</p><h3>The Best Time To Visit The Maldives</h3><p>The best time to
      visit the Maldives is from December to April. Whilst the weather is
      perfect during this time, it&rsquo;s also the busiest season to visit so
      expect crowds and higher prices all round.</p><p>May to October is
      considered the rainy season but with this comes more affordable
      accommodation options. If you're looking for surf, this is also the best
      time to visit as the swell is biggest during the rainy season.</p><p>Last
      year (2018) we visited the Maldives in August for 6 days and it rained for
      5. It was still lovely and we had a great time, just be aware of this if
      you want so spend some time in the sun.</p><p>In 2019, we traveled to the
      Maldives during November and only had one day of rain, which we welcomed
      after spending a week soaking up the sun. The shoulder seasons are the
      best time to plan your getaway as the islands aren&rsquo;t as busy.</p>

      <h3>Best local islands in the Maldives</h3><p>3 or so years ago, the
      government allowed the local islands in the Maldives to open guest houses
      and hotels. Since then, there&rsquo;s been a surge of budget travelers
      visiting.</p><p>We love that these small businesses can operate and create
      work opportunities for people living on those islands, whilst also
      allowing budget travelers to experience just how amazing the Maldives
      is.</p><p>Below we&rsquo;ve covered 3 local islands in the Maldives:
      Thulusdhoo, Dhigurah, and Goidhoo.</p><p>When planning your trip,
      it&rsquo;s best to stick to 2 or 3 local islands as the fast boats getting
      to and from them can be quite costly. We have tons of behind-the-scenes
      stories on our&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17866901527518257/"><u>Instagram
      highlights</u></a>&nbsp;so check those out!</p><p>If you&rsquo;re
      traveling on a budget, but still want a taste of that luxury Maldives
      lifestyle, you can check out the resorts close to the local islands. Often
      these luxury resorts allow for day visitors to enjoy their facilities and
      restaurants. There are costs involved for this, but it&rsquo;s way more
      affordable than staying at the resort itself.</p>

    main-paragraph-emphasis: 3 of the best local islands in the Maldives
    body-content_html: >-
      <h3>Thulusdhoo Island</h3><p>Thulusdhoo was the first stop of our Maldives
      island hopping adventure and it didn&rsquo;t disappoint!</p><p>To get to
      Thulusdoo, you need to take a 30-minute boat ride from the capital city of
      Male. This one-way trip costs $30 per person.</p><p>Thulusdhoo is one of
      the closest budget islands to Male, and so it&rsquo;s the most popular of
      the 3 local islands in the Maldives. There are over 20 guest houses on the
      island, with prices starting from $65 per room per night.</p><p>After
      arriving in Thulusdhoo, you&rsquo;ll notice the quiet, sandy streets and
      the beautiful white powdery beach that steals the show!</p><h4>Things to
      do in Thulusdhoo</h4><p>Thulusdhoo is an adventure playground as there are
      so many exciting water-sports available including skiing or wake boarding.
      Scuba diving is also a popular activity here and there are 2 dive shops on
      the island.</p><p>The surf breaks near Thulusdhoo attract scores of
      surfers and are considered the best places to surf in the Maldives. These
      include &ldquo;Cokes&rdquo; which is a fast right-hander and
      &ldquo;Chicken&rsquo;s&rdquo; which is a long peeling left.</p><p>The best
      way to explore Thulusdhoo is to go out on a boat for the day ($100) and
      visit the nearby snorkeling sites and sandbars. If you split this cost
      between 6 people, as we did, it really is affordable.</p><p>One of our
      highlights was free-diving in Thulusdhoo. Although the visibility
      wasn&rsquo;t great at the time, we were lucky enough to swim with both
      turtles and dolphins. Eagle Rays are also common sightings in the
      area.</p><p>After long days out on the ocean, we ended off with beach
      yoga. We highly recommend this, not only for your well-being but also to
      enjoy the pristine beaches, quiet surroundings, and gorgeous
      sunset.</p><h4>Where To Stay In Thulusdhoo</h4><ul><li>Season Paradise:
      $90 per room per night, including breakfast</li></ul>

      <h3>Dhigurah Island</h3><p>Dhigurah Island is further north of Thulusdhoo
      and translated directly, which means &ldquo;long island&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s
      only 3km long and 250m wide!</p><p>We loved Dhigurah island! It&rsquo;s
      the epitome of simple island life with gorgeous sunsets and secluded
      beaches.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a paradise island and is regarded as one of the
      most beautiful places in the Maldives. The best part? You can visit
      Dhigurah Island on a budget.</p><p>But, because of its remote location,
      Dhigurah Island is slightly more expensive than the other local islands in
      the Maldives, with accommodation staring at around $90 per room.</p><p>To
      get to Dhigurah from Thulusdhoo, you need to go back to Male. You then hop
      on another speedboat which will take 2 hours to get to Dhigurah and costs
      $55 per person. Alternatively, you could fly from Male to Dhigurah but
      this costs $270 for the round
      trip.</p><h4>&nbsp;</h4><h4>&nbsp;</h4><h4>Things To Do In Dhigurah
      Island</h4><p>As with all local islands in the Maldives, the main
      attractions lie beyond the seashore.</p><p>Dhigurah Island is the only
      area in the Maldives where whale sharks and manta rays are spotted all
      year round.</p><p>Learning about the whale sharks was one of our
      highlights on Dhigurah Island. These gentle giants move through this area
      naturally, and it isn&rsquo;t a tourist trap (like we&rsquo;ve experienced
      elsewhere)</p><p>When whale sharks move towards the surface, they&rsquo;re
      coming to regulate their temperature. Make sure you stay at least 3m away
      from them and don&rsquo;t stress out. They are huge, but they are also
      harmless!</p><p>There are amazing scuba diving sites here where it&rsquo;s
      highly likely that you&rsquo;ll swim with sharks and other beautiful
      marine life.</p><h4>Where to stay in Dhigurah</h4><ul><li>Bliss Dhigurah:
      $100 per night for a double room which includes breakfast.</li></ul>

      <h3>Goidhoo Island</h3><p>Goidhoo is the smallest of the 3 local islands
      we visited. Not many people live here and there are only 2 guesthouses on
      the island.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for seclusion and tranquility,
      this is the best local island to visit in the Maldives!</p><p>To get to
      Goidhoo Island, you need to take a speed boat from the main island, Male.
      This is under 2 hours and costs $80 for the return trip.</p><h4>Where to
      stay in Goidhoo Island</h4><ul><li>Olive Goidhoo: $70 a night for a double
      room including breakfast</li></ul><h4>Things to do in Goidhoo
      Island</h4><p>Take the cruiser bikes from Olive Giodhoo and explore the
      peaceful island. You will find a beautiful white beach at the far end of
      the island about a 10-minute ride from town. Spend the day relaxing and
      enjoying the calming nature of Giodhoo.</p><p>We also went out on a
      catamaran and explored the surrounding islands including Fulhadhoo Island
      which is just 15-minutes away from Goidhoo. If you have the chance, pack
      some snacks, park off at one of the sandbars and spend your afternoon
      lazing in the sun and freediving just off the beach.</p><p>The best way to
      explore Goidhoo Island itself is by bike as it&rsquo;s the only way to get
      around.</p>

      <h3>Luxury Resorts In The Maldives For The Perfect Honeymoon</h3><p>If
      you&rsquo;re planning a luxurious honeymoon, Maldives is the place to go!
      You can also spend most of your time on the local islands and treat
      yourselves to one or two nights at the below resorts before you head back
      home.</p><h4>Amilla Fushi</h4><p>After spending 9 days exploring local
      islands in the Maldives, we headed to Amilla Fushi, a gorgeous resort
      surrounded by crystal clear water.</p><p>The name &ldquo;Amilla
      Fushi&rdquo; translates to &ldquo;My Island Home&rdquo; and it sure lives
      up to this!</p><p>Amilla Fushi has everything you want, and more: A
      private villa with an infinity pool and a beautiful hammock perched in the
      ocean. Not to mention the spacious room and outdoor shower!</p><p>The
      waters surrounding Amilla Fushi are home to hundreds of Manta Rays and
      Sting Rays. This is the biggest attraction here and an experience
      we&rsquo;ll never forget.</p><p>As we hopped into the water, a huge
      squadron of manta rays swam past us - this moment was surreal!</p><p>We
      loved our time here. From jet skiing to exploring the underwater world on
      a sea bob, to afternoon swims in the rain, Amilla Fushi is an incredible
      place to visit if your budget allows for it.</p><h4>Soneva</h4><p>Soneva
      is unlike any luxury resort we&rsquo;ve visited - ever! It&rsquo;s more
      famously known for its water slide but there&rsquo;s so much more to love
      about Soneva.</p><p>The beautiful, minimalist wooden villas have thatched
      roofs as sustainability is one of the main focuses
      here.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a vegetable garden on the property and most
      produce from here is used in the kitchen (which serves the most delicious,
      tasty vegan food we&rsquo;ve ever had!)</p><p>Soneva recycles and reuses
      90% of everything from food to plastic and glass. Their focus is on a SLOW
      life - Sustainable, local, organic, wellness. We love this mission and it
      was great to go behind the scenes and see how Soneva is bringing their
      vision to life.</p>

      <h3>Tips For Visiting Local Islands In The Maldives (or Luxury
      Resorts)</h3><ul><li>If you&rsquo;re looking for the best vegan food in
      the Maldives, make sure you pop into Shell Beans on the main island of
      Male.</li><li>There are small supermarkets on all the local islands in the
      Maldives where you can buy snacks, water, and fruit.</li><li>Each of the
      local islands have cafes where you&rsquo;ll pay between $5-$15 per
      meal.</li><li>Most guesthouses offer half-board and full-board options so
      be sure to inquire about this before you make your reservation. The full
      board option is approximately and an additional $30 per person per
      day.</li><li>After landing at the airport on Male Island, it&rsquo;s best
      to buy a sim card. This cost us $30 for 17gigs of data.</li><li>When
      snorkeling or diving, please don&rsquo;t touch or stand on coral. We see
      this happening too often and coral is destroyed by these reckless
      actions.</li><li>Wear reef free sunscreen as chemicals from normal
      sunscreens are harmful to the underwater ecosystem.</li><li><a
      href="https://www.mariefeandjakesnow.com/blog/2018/12/16/sri-lanka-3-weeks"><u>Sri
      Lanka</u></a> is a stone's throw away from the Maldives so it&rsquo;s a
      great add-on to your Sri Lanka trip.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Tip How To
      Plan Your Maldives Trip On a Budget</h3><p>We&rsquo;ve only spoken about 3
