  There are times when travelling you are so blown away by a place or an
  experience that you literally cannot find words to describe it.

  <p>Our tour around the Komodo Islands falls into this category! For every stop
  on the tour we could not believe what we were seeing. The variety of
  landscapes and experiences was unbelievable. Incredible hiking, epic sunrises
  and sunsets, jaw dropping wildlife, diving, pink beaches, sand-bars and clear
  blue skies are just a fraction of what you can expect from the Komodo
  Islands.&nbsp;</p><p>Here we have put together our Ultimate Komodo Islands
  Bucket List to make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out on the experience of a
  lifetime.</p>

      <h3>1 . WITNESS KOMODO DRAGONS ON RINCA ISLAND</h3><p>These Komodo dragons
      have to be seen to be believed. They are huge!! Rinca and Komodo Island are
      the only places in the entire world that you will find these prehistoric
      creatures. Growing up to 3m long and weighing up to 80kg these Komodo dragons
      look like modern day dinosaurs.&nbsp;</p><p>On Rinca Island a tour guide will
      guide you around a section of the island to help you find&nbsp; some of these
      creatures. We visited the island during mating season between the months of
      May and August. This meant that the dragons were either quite placid to
      conserve energy or they were already in their holes to lay eggs.&nbsp; We
      managed to see 4 dragons. The tour guide who is also a ranger on the island
      carefully overlooked as we managed to get with 3-4 metres of the female
      dragons.&nbsp;</p><p>The dragons feed on water buffalo, deer, monkeys and
      birds, all of which we saw on our island tour.&nbsp;</p><p>This was an unreal
      experience. Having watched so many animal documentaries as a child this was a
      huge tick on the bucket list. It feels like your on set with David
      Attenborough, just make sure you don&rsquo;t get to close to those sleepy
      giants!&nbsp;</p><h3>2 . HIKE UP PADAR ISLAND FOR SUNRISE</h3><p>Padar island
      looks like something straight out of Jurassic Park. The steep volcanic
      mountain ranges are surrounded by deep bays which combined, give you a breath
      taking view from the top. This sunrise was something we will never
      forget.&nbsp;</p><p>The climb to the top takes about 20 minutes, by the time
      the sun is up it can be quite crowded at the top. To avoid the crowds and give
      ourselves the best chance at getting those Insta-worthy pics, we turned right
      at the top of the first set of stairs instead of left. We essentially had our
      own half of the island for all of sunrise. If you like avoiding the crowds
      this could be for you.&nbsp;</p><p>You can always hike to the top once the sun
      is up, the view from the top is still amazing and by then the crowd has
      dispersed giving you a bit more room to move.&nbsp;</p><h3>3 . SPLASH AROUND
      AT THE PINK BEACH</h3><p>Have you ever gone on an adventure to find a
      &lsquo;pink beach&rsquo; only to arrive and find that its not really even
      pink? Well forget about that here! The Pink Beach, or Pantai Merah which it is
      also called, is one of seven pink beaches on the planet and this beach really
      is pink. This hidden beach only accessible by boat gets its pink color from
      microscopic animals called Foraminifera, which produce a red pigment on the
      coral reefs.</p><p>Arriving at this beach was like a fairytale. We were the
      only people on the beach that stretched for 400m. The water is bright blue and
      as the waves hit the shore it mixes up the pink sand creating a fairyfloss
      looking effect. Absolutely incredible!&nbsp;</p><p>This beach is the perfect
      spot to relax, take some photos, do some snorkelling and just marvel at the
      beauty of our planet. You will notice that the beach is super clean. Please
      keep it that way and take our rubbish with you, maybe even pick a few pieces
      up while your there.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>4 . SEE A SPECTACULAR PHENOMENON AT
      KALONG ISLAND</strong></h3><p>As the sun sets over Kalong Island the trees
      begin to rustle with activity. The boats line up in the calm water waiting for
      something spectacular to happen. One bat spreads its wings and flies out from
      the trees. Then 3 bats follow, then 5 more. All of a sudden thousands of bats
      fill the pinky, purple sky. The bats are flying back to the mainland to sleep
      over night. This daily migration is one of the most beautiful things we have
      ever seen and an unexpected part of our Komodo islands tour. You really have
      to see this for yourself to believe it, trust us when we say that you will be
      in awe of this amazing event.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>5 . ESCAPE TO PARADISE AT
      TAKA MAKASSAR</strong></h3><p>When we think of paradise, this is what comes to
      mind. Crystal clear water, bright white sand and your own secluded sand bar to
      share with other travellers.&nbsp;</p><p>This sand bar is smaller than a
      football field and is surrounded by stunning blue water. The water is shallow
      therefore the biggest cannot get to close which makes it perfect for
      snorkelling and free diving.&nbsp;</p><p>Our camera equipment got a workout at
      this amazing natural wonder. We captured amazing aerial photos and videos with
      our Mavic Pro, some pristine underwater shots with our gopro 6 and white beach
      couple shots that never get old on our Panasonic GH4.&nbsp;</p><p>Take your
      time to relax or go crazy taking photos, either way you will love this
      place.</p><p>As content creators and travellers in general, this tour around
      the Komodo Islands was something we will never forget. The quality of content
      we were able to produce and the experiences we had, were absolutely top notch.
