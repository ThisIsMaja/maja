  <h2>The Story Behind Island Life Poke</h2><p>If you&rsquo;ve been following us
  for some time you will know that both healthy and delicious food is one of our
  greatest passions. We are strong believers that what we put in our bodies
  impacts our wellbeing, not just on a physical level, but on an emotional and
  mental level as well - how we feel, how much energy we have, how strong and
  how capable we are.</p><p>Back in March 2020, when the situation in the worls
  really began to escalate, we all had to adapt to a new conscious way of living
  when it came to health and wellbeing. Everybody had to experience &lsquo;the
  new normal&rsquo; in their own way. Some took a well-deserved break and some
  finally found the time to do the things they always wanted to do.</p><p>For
  Marie and I, we spent 6 months in Bali, which was the longest time we had
  spent in one place since we have known each other. It felt weird at the
  beginning as we were so used to being constantly active on and on the
  move.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of being consumed by the negativity and fear we
  tried to pivot and turn this new pace into a positive. We took those months as
  an opportunity to slow down and to work on passion projects whilst also
  looking for new opportunities that we would never have had time for
  before.</p>

**H2 - The Story Behind Island Life Poke**

If you’ve been following us for some time you will know that both healthy and delicious food is one of our greatest passions. We are strong believers that what we put in our bodies impacts our wellbeing, not just on a physical level, but on an emotional and mental level as well - how we feel, how much energy we have, how strong and how capable we are.

Back in March 2020, when the global Coronavirus pandemic really began to escalate, we all had to adapt to a new conscious way of living when it came to health and wellbeing. Everybody had to experience ‘the new normal’ in their own way. Some took a well-deserved break and some finally found the time to do the things they always wanted to do.

For Marie and I, we spent our quarantine in Bali, which was the longest time we had spent in one place since we have known each other. It felt weird at the beginning as we were so used to being constantly active on and on the move.&nbsp;

Instead of being consumed by the negativity and fear we tried to pivot and turn this new pace into a positive. We took those months as an opportunity to slow down and to work on passion projects whilst also looking for new opportunities that we would never have had time for before.

**H2 - The Creation of Island Life Poke**

After spending a few months in Canggu we decided to switch things up a little bit and moved down to the surfers paradise that is Uluwatu.

For the first time in a long time we felt we could relax without the pressures of always being in character which coincided with meeting amazing new friends who had no preconceptions about who we were.

This level of comfort led to friendships escalating very quickly and before we knew it, we were going into a creative passion project together - ISLAND LIFE POKE.

The idea was to create not only the best poke bowls in Uluwatu but in the whole of Bali. And our ultimate goal was to serve delicious, nutritious and local food that helped customers hit their health goals without sacrificing taste.

We really hope to grow this business to a point where we can really support the local economy and create initiatives/programs that will benefit people and the planet\!

**H2 - What is a Poke bowl (poh-keh)?**

This dish comes from Hawaiian cuisine and in the local language means “to slice or cut”.

An original poke recipe includes raw marinated fish, typically Ahi or Yellowfin tuna, that’s cut in cubes and layered on top of the sticky rice and complemented with pickles.

Nowadays you can find dozens of different poke bowl variations and you can be as creative as you want with them which is what we love\!

It’s no secret that we live on a plant based diet, and for so long we have been so regimented on this. After some reflection and conversations with our partners we realised that to encourage others to explore the plant based diet, we had to create a diverse menu which would be more inclusive for all diets and tastes.

It’s not easy to get people to buy into a plant based diet especially when almost all plant based restaurants don’t have any meat options. The chances of getting a meat eater to go to an exclusive plant based restaurant for dinner is very unlikely but give them a few choices and all of sudden we have a non judgemental way of including everybody.&nbsp;

Having this diverse menu was a new concept for us but after some soul searching it felt like a step in the right direction and a massive opportunity to impact more people and ultimately do more good.

If we could get just one meat eater to try a friend's plant based dish then for us this would be an Island Life Poke success\!
