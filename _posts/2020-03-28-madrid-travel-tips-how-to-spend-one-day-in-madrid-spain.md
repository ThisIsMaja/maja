  <p>Madrid is the capital city of Spain and tops my list of favorite European
  cities. Not only for its iconic buildings, gorgeous gardens, and delicious
  food. But also for the personal connection I have with the city. It&rsquo;s
  where I grew up</p><p>My family decided to move to Madrid when I was 3 weeks
  old and we stayed there for 3 years before moving back to Germany. This was
  one of the many reasons why I was so excited to visit Madrid with Jake - To
  show him a bit more of my life and where I spent my first few
  years.</p><p>Unfortunately, we only had a 24-hour layover in Madrid and so we
  had to make the most of our short visit. One day in Madrid may not seem like
  enough time to explore the city, but if you plan your itinerary right, you can
  do a lot, and eat your way through the city.</p><p><strong>Here are our travel
  tips for spending one day in Madrid!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
