  What we love the most about Bali amongst a whole list of things, is the fact
  we can eat healthy food everyday without giving up variety or taste.
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>There are hundreds of amazing restaurants and cafes in Bali that offer
  either a fully plant based menu or at least a handful of plant based options.
  Our favourite of them all is Kynd! Today we want to share with you 5 easy
  recipes directly from the <a
  href="https://www.kyndcommunity.com/menu-primary">Kynd menu</a> so you can
  bring a little taste of Bali into your kitchen at
  home.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>This Saturday afternoon at 7.00pm Bali time (GMT
  +8) We will be going Live on our instagram with the Co-Founders of Kynd,
  Corryn and Lauren to cook up our favourite Vegan Mexi Burrito with Vegan
  chipotle sauce. If you are interested in cooking along with us and the timing

      banana, frozen</p><p>50g mango, frozen&nbsp;</p><p>1&frasl;4 cup

      tablespoons coconut flakes&nbsp;</p><p>1&frasl;2 mango, big thick
      slices</p><p>1 sprig
      mint&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>METHOD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Blend
      together all smoothie ingredients. Remember to slowly add the liquid and
      only as much as needed. It is easier to put more in than take it out, and
      the texture of the smoothie bowl is the most important
      part.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now for the mango letters, you need to cut
      your mango into 1/2cm thick slices. Using your letter cutters, select
      which word you are going to use and cut away. It can take a few times to
      perfect, so be patient.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TO
      SERVE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Spread a layer of granola on top of your
      smoothie, this will help to make a base for your garnish. Top with sliced
      banana, strawberries, coconut flakes, chia, mint leaves and your mango
      letters.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      SAUCE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>1 cup coconut cream</p><p>3&frasl;4 cup brown
      sugar</p><p>Pinch salt</p><p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
      (optional)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PANCAKES&nbsp;</strong></p><p>2
      tablespoons Vegan butter, melted</p><p>1 1&frasl;2 cups all-purpose
      flour</p><p>2 cups soy milk or any plant-based milk&nbsp;</p><p>1 teaspoon
      baking powder&nbsp;</p><p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract&nbsp;</p><p>2.5
      tablespoons white or brown sugar&nbsp;</p><p>Coconut oil or extra Vegan
      butter, to coat pan</p><p>2
      bananas</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>METHOD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For the
      caramel sauce, use a small pot or pan and mix together all ingredients.
      Heat on medium-high heat, stirring consistently. Once the mixture is
      bubbling, reduce the heat and simmer for approx. 5 minutes or until the
      mixture starts to thicken.&nbsp; Note: The sauce will thicken most when
      cooled. You can use the caramel sauce straight away or allow to cool and
      store in the fridge for around 1 week.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To make
      pancakes, first melt the butter, then mix together with the flour, milk,
      baking powder, vanilla extract and sugar in a bowl. If your mixture is too
      thick, add a little more milk until you get the desired consistency. It
      shouldn&rsquo;t be too thick or too thin. You want a consistency similar
      to cream.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Heat your non-stick frypan and use
      coconut oil or butter to coat your pan. Pour approx. 1&frasl;2 cup of the
      mixture into the pan and swirl around to get a bigger pancake. Thinly
      slice a banana long ways and place the banana onto the pancake as
      it&rsquo;s cooking.&nbsp;</p><p>Wait for the bubbles to appear in the
      pancake and flip it over.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TO
      SERVE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Garnish with strawberries, caramel sauce and
      shredded coconut.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are short on time skip the caramel
      sauce and use maple syrup.</p>

      this coat your boiled potatoes in corn flour. Add the vegetable oil to
      your frypan and heat over high heat. Add your potatoes and fry until
      golden brown. Transfer to paper towel.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In another

      Mayo.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To roll your burrito, wrap the top edge
      over tightly and take both sides and continue rolling it closed. Heat your
      dry pan and place the burrito on top. Rotate the burrito until you get a
      nice golden brown tortilla on both
      sides.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      frozenor fresh (frozen corn must be defrosted)</p><p>2 big

      (optional)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>METHOD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Place
      the corn into a blender or food processor and pulse four times. Be sure
      not to let it continuously blend as the fritters are yummier with the
      bigger the kernels. Transfer to a large mixing
      bowl.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now blend the big chilli, coconut cream,
      shallots, garlic, coriander powder, salt, sugar and vegetable stock until
      it forms a paste.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Add the paste, flour and water
      to the mixing bowl and mix everything together. When everything is well
      combined, use your hands and scoop a small handful of the mixture. If it
      can hold together without falling apart, you are ready to cook them. If
      you are using the kaffir lime leaves and celery leaves you can add them
      here.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Heat oil in frypan on medium-high heat
      until hot. Using a desert spoon, scoop out a heaped spoon of mixture and
      shape into a fritter, 1cm thick. Any thicker and the fritter won&rsquo;t
      cook on the inside.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once you see the fritter
      starting to brown, flip it over. Cook both sides until golden brown and
      crunchy. Let cool on paper towel to absorb any of the excess
      oil.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
