      <h2>1. Living a Minimalist Lifestyle</h2><p>One thing that we are all
      guilty of as humans are living a life of abundance. Marie and I are for
      sure guilty of this too from time to time.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the basic
      human instinct to strive for more money, more power and more possessions
      which can cloud your judgement on what&rsquo;s really important in
      life.</p><p>One thing van life does is forces us to completely reset and
      reevaluate on how much we need to survive.</p><p>With limited space,
      especially living space available, you can&rsquo;t afford to have all the
      biggest and best appliances, the wardrobes full of clothes that mostly go
      unworn, and cupboards full of unnecessary items.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a
      fantastic reminder to ourselves that we only really need the bare van life
      essentials, each other and the things we need for our business to
      survive.</p><p>What a great breath of fresh air and mental clearance to be
      able to cut back on the amount of stuff that you have around you and in
      your possession.</p>
