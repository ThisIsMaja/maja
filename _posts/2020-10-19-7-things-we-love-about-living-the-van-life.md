      <h2>1. Living a Minimalist Lifestyle</h2><p>One thing that we are all
      guilty of as humans are living a life of abundance. Marie and I are for
      sure guilty of this too from time to time.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the basic
      human instinct to strive for more money, more power and more possessions
      which can cloud your judgement on what&rsquo;s really important in
      life.</p><p>One thing van life does is forces us to completely reset and
      reevaluate on how much we need to survive.</p><p>With limited space,
      especially living space available, you can&rsquo;t afford to have all the
      biggest and best appliances, the wardrobes full of clothes that mostly go
      unworn, and cupboards full of unnecessary items.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a
      fantastic reminder to ourselves that we only really need the bare van life
      essentials, each other and the things we need for our business to
      survive.</p><p>What a great breath of fresh air and mental clearance to be
      able to cut back on the amount of stuff that you have around you and in
      your possession.</p>

      <h2>2. Van Life Benefits Our Mental &amp; Physical Health</h2><p>There is
      no doubting that Marie and I live a pretty intense lifestyle as we go
      about documenting everything we do via this blog and our social media
      channels.</p><p>Living life under the microscope and in the public eye can
      put a strain on everything from our business to our
      relationship.</p><p>Life in a van allows us to have this little safe. As
      soon as we close the doors to the van we feel like we can really switch
      off and have time to ourselves both individually and as a
      couple.</p><p>This is so vital for us to ensure that we continue to be the
      best version of ourselves which in turn allows us to keep spreading our
      message of love and positivity every single day.</p><p>Not only can we
      chill out and read a book or watch a Netflix series together, but we can
      also drive somewhere scenic and go for a relaxing walk which allows us to
      exercise both physically and mentally.</p><p>Of all the modes of transport
      and accommodation that we have experienced in our travels, van life for us
      is by far and away from the most therapeutic and beneficial to our mental
      and physical health.</p>

      <h2>3. Van Life Is A Great Financial Investment</h2><p>Living the van life
      is an attainable goal for most people and budgets. Unlike buying a home
      and having to get a mortgage, you can actually pick up your own home on
      wheels for a fraction of the cost.</p><p>From a van conversion fixer-upper
      at a couple of thousand dollars to a deluxe home on wheels, there really
      is something for everything.</p><p>Our very own van life story started in
      Australia back in 2016 when we bought a Toyota Spacia 1987 for 2000
      euros.</p><p>Back then we had only started documenting our travel &amp;
      lifestyle whilst crunching out the long hours working in the
      vineyard.</p><p>It had been a shared goal of ours ever to buy and fix up a
      van ever since we met. With that determination to make our goals a
      reality, we worked hard to save the money to buy the van and to do it up
      to our own taste.</p><p>All in all our little Aussie home on wheels cost
      us around 2750 euros which wouldn&rsquo;t have got us much in terms of
      real estate.</p>

      <h2>4. Low Running Costs</h2><p>Not only is investing in a van to buy and
      fix up it also should not cost too much in terms of running costs
      either.</p><p>That is when comparing the usual mortgage and utility bills
      that you would have with some bricks and mortar.</p><p>Touchwood you have
      a reliable van which means you&rsquo;re only really forking out for fuel,
      general maintenance and fees for parking up.</p><p>Of course with any
      vehicle you run the risk of having the usual issues with the engine, tyres
      etc, but with a little maintenance and some luck you shouldn&rsquo;t run
      into too many running or repair costs.</p><p>Thankfully we've never really
      run into any issues but you absolutely can be sure we have now jinxed
      ourselves by saying this now!</p><p>I guess this would all be part of the
      authentic van life experience.</p>

      <h2>5. Van Life Gives Us A Feeling Of Freedom</h2><p>Are you like us and
      have an insatiable appetite for the feeling of freedom?</p><p>For the
      first time in our relationship, we had our feet planted in Bali due to the
      current situation we find ourselves in 2020.</p><p>As much as we love Bali
      and Indonesia and all the freedom you have to explore the countless
      beautiful islands, we missed that freedom of being able to pack up our
      things and drive to a new destination every single day.</p><p>We strive
      for variety and crave the exciting and the new. There is nothing that
      satisfies that more than living and travelling in a van.</p><p>What a
      feeling to choose where you decide to stop and sleep every night. One day
      you could park up in the city and the next you could be by the ocean
      listening to the crashing of the waves.</p><p>The anxiety of restrictions
      and limitations feel completely lifted as soon as we get back to living
      that van life.</p>

      <h2>6. We Can Bring Our Pets</h2><p>One of the hardest things about
      leaving Bali was having to leave behind our beloved little dog,
      Leo.</p><p>Living in a van again has made the distance greater and the
      heart heavier because we wish that he was here with us to experience
      this.</p><p>One thing that gives us great comfort in knowing that when
      things settle down in the future, we can bring Leo along in our van life
      adventures with us.</p><p>Imagine the life of a pet living in a van with a
      new place to explore every single day?</p><p>Animals love to go out and
      adventure and what greater way to fulfil them than by allowing them to
      live the van life with you too.</p><p>We tend to gravitate towards open
      spaces with beautiful and scenic nature which would be the ideal
      playground for Leo to run around until his heart and soul is
      content.</p><p>If you have done van life with your pets then please feel
      free to share them with us as we would love to see them!</p>

      <h2>7. We Can't Wait To Experience Van Life With Kids</h2><p>It&rsquo;s
      inevitable that Marie and I will one day buy a van to live in either full
      time or part-time depending on our circumstances.</p><p>One thing that we
      absolutely cannot wait for, and that makes us so inspired and excited with
      living the van life, is to experience this with our children one
      day.</p><p>We can&rsquo;t think of a better way of having kids interact
      with this world than doing it from all the freedoms, challenges and
      experiences which come with buying a van to live in.</p><p>There are no
      doubts that living in a van and travelling with children would be intense.
      However, we are absolutely certain that it would help not only create once
      in a lifetime experiences as a family but also play a huge part in
      moulding and shaping our children into humans with love, respect and
      humility.</p><p>Have you ever tried living the van life with your
      children? If so let us know in the comments below, we would love to hear
      your thoughts and experiences!</p>

      <h2>Is Living The Van Life For You?</h2><p>Have we managed to convince you
      that living out of a van is for you?</p><p>Marie and I hope that we have
      either rekindled some of your own van life memories, made you beam with
      pride of the van life that you currently live, or sparked an interest in
      creating your very own van life adventure.</p><p>If you would love to
      share a van life story of your own, or even ask us any more questions in
      regards to van life, then please leave a comment below and we will get
      back to you asap.</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
