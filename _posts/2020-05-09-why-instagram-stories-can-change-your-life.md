  In this ever evolving digital world, learning how to create beautiful content
  that emotionally connects with people online can open up opportunities in your
  life you never knew existed.

  <p>Instagram stories are not only an effective and easy way to show little
  snippets of your day to your family and friends, they also provide the perfect
  training ground to learn how to create engaging content and build confidence
  in front of the camera. If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of building your own
  business from nothing or sharing a message you&rsquo;re passionate about with
  a global audience, knowing how to create great content and effectively
  communicate through content online is an absolute must. Learning how to
  connect and share with others online has changed our lives and enabled us to
  build our dream lifestyle. It can do the same for you if you&rsquo;re willing
  to put in the time and effort. Over time, creating and sharing everyday has
  also given us the confidence to speak out and be proud of ourselves and what
  we represent.&nbsp;</p><p>In this post we will share with you the tips and
  tricks we&rsquo;ve learnt in the past four years that have helped us grow our
  instagram to over 700,000 people and allow us to connect with 80,000+ people
  who watch our instagram stories daily.&nbsp;</p><p>Before we share all this
  with you, we want to explain why we think it's important to learn how to
  create and share in this new digital world. We also want to share our story
  with you. It&rsquo;s important to know that we<em> </em>all have to start
  somewhere. We definitely weren't confident in the beginning either. If you
  want to skip right to the tips and tricks click <strong><a

      <p>For the past 3 years, we have been posting 20 to 30 instagram stories
      every single day. If you're thinking &lsquo;well you guys must be
      naturals&rsquo; then think again. In the beginning it felt so wrong!! We
      felt awkward and we weren't confident that people would actually get value
      or care about what we were saying. However, we stuck with it because we
      thought if at least one person would smile or be inspired by what we were
      doing, then that would be enough. It didn't take long before we had proof
      that at least one person liked what we were doing. We started receiving
      messages from people telling us that our courage and stories were
      inspirational. That was all the motivation we needed to continue creating
      and sharing everyday.&nbsp;</p><p>You are special and you have something
      to offer the world! If you feel like you want to share your voice, your
      talents, your vision with the world then you MUST. There will always be
      people that will try to bring you down or laugh at you but those people
      have their own issues. Don't let them control how you feel about yourself
      and certainly don't let them stop you from creating a life you are proud
      of.</p><p>Now that you know you can do it and that we were once in exactly
      the same position as you with the same fears and same worries -
      let&rsquo;s talk about how you can start creating Instagram stories that
      will catch peoples attention and give them
      value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
