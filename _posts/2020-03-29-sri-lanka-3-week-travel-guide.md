  <p>This country really blew us away. We honestly can not find a bad word to
  say about our experience in Sri Lanka. For a country that looks so small on
  the map, it has so much to offer. Pristine beaches, surf, desert
  safari&rsquo;s, mountain hikes, jungle, amazing plant-based food, and exotic
  wild animals just to name a few.&nbsp;</p><p>We spent a jam-packed 3 weeks in
  Sri Lanka, we feel like this was a good amount of time although 1 more week
  would have been perfect. Read on to see where we stayed and what we did for
  our 3 weeks in Sri Lanka.</p>

Don&rsquo;t worry, you can get your ticket last minute at the train station.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to visit Sri Lanka during low season. We only had one rainy day.&nbsp; Low season is much cheaper, you can save up to 40-50% on rooms and its not very busy at all.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>If you need more information or want to plan a guided tour through Sri Lanka we cannot speak highly enough of Mindful Travels. This is a tour company owned by our good friend Amar. He is one of the most genuine and caring people we have met in all our travels. You can find his website <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mindfultravels.net/\"><u>here</u></a>. If you mention that you know Marie and Jake, he will give you a good deal \U0001F642</p>"

      <h2>COLOMBO/ Mount Lavinia</h2><h4>Day 1-2</h4><p>After arriving at the
      airport we took a cab straight to Mt Lavinia. The ride was about 45
      minutes through traffic. We spent the next couple days soaking up the new
      culture by walking around the streets close to our hostel. We found a
      couple nice beaches and some nice restaurants.&nbsp;</p><p>A couple days
      in Mt Lavinia is enough to get a taste of Sri Lankan life before heading
      south. If you decide to head down south first like we did, take the train
      &ndash; it&rsquo;s very easy cheap and an incredible experience. You can
      get your ticket last minute at the train station.&nbsp;</p><h3>Where to

      <h2>Old Town GALLE</h2><h4>Day 2-4</h4><p>Galle was one of our big
      surprises on this trip. You might not believe it but we don&rsquo;t do a
      lot of research before we visit a place. We like to experience new places
      with no expectation. Galle Fort is an old city founded by Portuguese
      colonists in the 16th century. Galle is a little old town surrounded by
      stone sea walls.&nbsp;</p><p>Walking through the streets it feels like an
      old European town that got a Sri Lankan makeover. You will find cute
      little shops, amazing local and western food and lots of photo
      opportunities. You will have to at least spend 2 days in Galle to
      experience this magical place.</p><h3>Where to eat at
      Galle</h3><ul><li>Lucky fort Restaurant (amazing local food, cute little
      restaurant, 10 curries for 2 people 15$)</li><li>Poonies Kitchen (a cute
      little oasis in Galle, enter through a Clothing Store, amazing smoothie
      bowls and healthy meals</li><li>Sea Waves Restaurant (cooking
      classes)</li></ul><h3>Where to stay at Galle</h3><ul><li><a

      <h2>Beach paradise &ndash; UNAWATUNA</h2><h4>Day 4-6</h4><p>Unawatuna felt
      a little bit like Sri Lanka&rsquo;s version of Bali&rsquo;s Uluwatu
      without the surf. There is one main street that leads towards to beach,
      full with shops, restaurants, spas hostel and hotels.</p><p>We spent 3 day
      here at Bed Space Beach, we highly recommend this place. The food was
      great for plant-based eaters and the location was also super close to the
      beach. We rented out a scooter for our time here so we could go back and
      forth to the beach swing, jungle beach and Galle without get a Tuk Tuk
      every time. It was $10 a day for a scooter, not as cheap as some other
      places but still worth it for full days exploring.</p><h3>Where to eat in

      <h2>Time for yoga and surfing &ndash; TALALLA</h2><h4>Day 6-10</h4><p>A
      lot of people stay in Mirissa next. We skipped it but would still
      recommend it as the beaches&nbsp; Our next stop was Talalla. The retreat
      we stayed at had it all. Wellness, Yoga, Surfing and great food. The area
      around Tallala is amazing as well. You will find the nicest beaches in Sri
      Lanka here.</p><p>For $15 US we rented a Tuk Tuk for 3 ppl to explore the
      area several hours.&nbsp; We took surfing lessons with the guys at Talalla

      it.</p><h3>Where to eat at Talalla</h3><ul><li>Talalla retreat (amazing

      <h2>It is time for the first SAFARI &ndash; YALA</h2><h4>Day
      10-12</h4><p>Yala National Park was the first time we had ever seen an
      Elephant in the wild and was our first National Park in Sri Lanka. For
      this reason Yala will always hold a special place in our hearts. We only
      stayed here for 2 days but it was unforgettable. Our tent at the <a

      buffalo and birds surrounded our tent one afternoon. It was one of our
      favorite experiences of the whole trip.</p><h3>Where stay at / eat at in

      <h2>Safari no. 2 &ndash; UDAWALAWE</h2><h4>Day 12-14</h4><p>Another place
      we went to experience a Safari. Compared to Yala, less Jeeps are allowed
      in the park. We saw our first elephant right next to the road on the way
      to our camp when we arrived. It was an insane experience. The male
      elephant was really calm and curious. We stayed at <a target="_blank"

      Lankans, we experienced real Sri Lankan hospitality. The food was amazing
      and so was the scenery, we paddled along a little river next to our camp
      in a canoe for sunset.&nbsp;</p><h3>Where to eat at

      <h2>Lush green in ELLA</h2><h4>Day 14-16</h4><p>We had heard great things
      about Ella before arriving. It definitely seemed to be a favorite among
      tourists. We could see why after our first day! Famous for beautiful
      hikes, viewpoints and of course the 9 Arch Bridge, we managed to take some
      epic pics in Ella. The town itself was quite busy, we didn&rsquo;t expect
      there to be so many people. Although it was busier, Ella has a really cool
      backpacker vibe.&nbsp;</p><p>We stayed in the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/lk/higher-ground-treehouse-ella.en.html?aid=1556632&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1"><u>Higherground
      Treehouse</u></a> which was really cool, we had so much fun playing around
      with the monkeys. They literally came into our treehouse when we left the
      door open. For nature, beautiful green mountains, picturesque tea
      plantations, and really cool backpacker scene, you will want to spend at
      least 4-5 days in Ella.&nbsp;</p><h3>The train from Ella to
      Kandy</h3><p>Most of you would have seen the photos of the blue train in
      Sri Lanka. The train ride from Ella to Kandy is one of the most popular
      tourist attractions in Sri Lanka. We are so happy that we reserved seats
      in 1st class the day before we left after we considered just arriving on
      the day and booking a ticket. It was really busy!! If you want to enjoy
      the amazing views and take some really nice photos without the stress of
      being squished in with 100 people, definitely reserve your set the day
      before.&nbsp;</p><p>Having said that, no matter what you do you will love
      this train ride. Absolute gorgeous scenes to wake up to. We recommend
      taking the early train so you can see how the light changes across the tea
      plantations as the sun rises.&nbsp;</p><h3>Where to eat in
      Ella</h3><ul><li>Ella Village Restaurant (great local food for a good
      price)</li><li>Cafe chill (Western food an local food)</li><li>The Barn
      (good Wifi, nice setup, good food)</li></ul><h3>Where to stay in
      Ella</h3><ul><li>Ella natural village (cheap, nice local family, great
      food, 5 min by scooter from Ella Centre)</li><li><a target="_blank"

      Treehouse</u></a> (very unique Treehouse, a lot of monkeys around, fits 6
      people, great Breakfast)</li></ul><h3>Things to do in Ella</h3><ul><li>9
      Arches Bridge ( go early &amp; if you want to the train it&rsquo;s passing
      at 9:15 am)</li><li>Waterfall hunting&nbsp;</li><li>Little Adams peak (20
      min hike, great view, good photos/ drive to 98 acres Hotel and ask from
      there)</li><li>Ella Rock&nbsp; (3-4hour hike, most people go for sunrise
      at 4:30 am)</li></ul>

      <h2>Finish with a bang &ndash; SIGIRIYA</h2><h4>Day 17-19</h4><p>The last
      stop on our epic 3 week Sri Lankan adventure was Sigiriya. What a way to
      finish off! From Sigiriya we took a day trip to Kaudulla National Park for
      one more safari. This was our favorite safari of the whole trip. Here you
      will see heads of 30-50 elephants roaming the grass plains. We highly
      recommend this safari.</p><p>Sigiriya itself is a quiet little town, most
      people are there to see and climb Sigiriya and Pidurangala rock. If you
      didn&rsquo;t have time or enough money to see both rocks in our opinion,
      taking into account the price and the popularity of these two sites, we
      would prefer to go to Pidurangala Rock. It is much cheaper ($3 instead of
      $35) and the view of Sigiriya rock from the top is
      spectacular.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to mention also that our little <a
      href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/lk/amba-sewana-homestay.en.html?aid=1556632&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1"><u>homestay</u></a>
      in Sigiriya was one of our favorite places to stay in all of Sri Lanka. It
      is very basic and definitely not luxury, but the local man that owns it is
      the kindest person. The food he and his wife prepared for us was
      incredible, I&rsquo;m getting hungry just thinking about it
      now!&nbsp;</p><h3>Where to eat in Sigiriya</h3><ul><li>Croissant hut (good
      food but we waited a long time for it)</li><li>Amba Sewana, our Homestay
      made great dinner</li></ul><h3>Where to stay in Sigiriya</h3><ul><li><a

      href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/lk/amba-sewana-homestay.en.html?aid=1556632&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1"><u>Amba
      Sewana Homestay</u></a> (amazing local family, central, 36$ for 2
      nights/3ppl incl breakfast, the owner will drive you to the rock for 3 $
      return)</li></ul><h3>Things to do in Sigiriya</h3><ul><li>Pidurangala Rock
      (only 3 $ entry, amazing view of the Sigiriya rock which is just in front
      of it, 30 min Hike)</li><li>Sigiriya Rock (35$, amazing view)</li><li>You
      might see wild elephants at the lake next to the
      homestay&nbsp;</li><li>Day trip to Kaudulla National park (best park to
      see a lot of elephants)</li></ul>
