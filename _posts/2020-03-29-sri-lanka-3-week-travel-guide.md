  is incredible

  <p>This country really blew us away. We honestly can not find a bad word to
  say about our experience in Sri Lanka. For a country that looks so small on
  the map, it has so much to offer. Pristine beaches, surf, desert
  safari&rsquo;s, mountain hikes, jungle, amazing plant-based food, and exotic
  wild animals just to name a few.&nbsp;</p><p>We spent a jam-packed 3 weeks in
  Sri Lanka, we feel like this was a good amount of time although 1 more week
  would have been perfect. Read on to see where we stayed and what we did for
  our 3 weeks in Sri Lanka.</p>

    body-content_html: "<h2>Helpful advice to start your trip</h2><ul><li>Get a sim card at the airport (Mobitel sim 40 Gb for 18$, works almost everywhere).</li><li>If you decide to head down south first, like we did, take the train &ndash; it&rsquo;s very easy cheap and an incredible experience. Don&rsquo;t worry, you can get your ticket last minute at the train station.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to visit Sri Lanka during low season. We only had one rainy day.&nbsp; Low season is much cheaper, you can save up to 40-50% on rooms and its not very busy at all.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>If you need more information or want to plan a guided tour through Sri Lanka we cannot speak highly enough of Mindful Travels. This is a tour company owned by our good friend Amar. He is one of the most genuine and caring people we have met in all our travels. You can find his website <a href=\"https://www.mindfultravels.net/\"><u>here</u></a>. If you mention that you know Marie and Jake, he will give you a good deal \U0001F642</p>"
