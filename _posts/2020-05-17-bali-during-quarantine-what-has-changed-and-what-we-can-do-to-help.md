  <p>Two and a half months ago at the start of the global pandemic we had a
  really hard decision to make, where do we go? For most people the answer is
  simple, 'home'. But for us it's kind of complicated. We've been travelling the

  home for us is still to be decided.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the seriousness of
  the situation we were forced to ask ourselves the question "where do we feel
  the most at home?&rdquo; and the answer was clear - Bali.&nbsp;</p><p>We have
  been here for 3 months now and we couldn&rsquo;t be happier about our
  decision. Although there have been a lot of changes on the island, we love
  this place and we love how the locals and foreigners combined have handled the
  difficult situation we all find ourselves in.</p><p>How has Bali faired
  compared to the rest of the world? Has this peaceful island turned into chaos?
  We know that a lot of you had to cancel your travel plans to come here and are
  probably wondering when you might be able to return.</p><p>So in this post, we
  want to share our observations with you of how life here in Bali has changed

Two and a half months ago at the start of the global pandemic we had a really hard decision to make, where do we go? For most people the answer is simple, 'home'. But for us it's kind of complicated. We've been travelling the world non stop for 4 years and although we have an apartment in Kuala Lumpur, home for us is still to be decided.&nbsp;

Because of the seriousness of the situation we were forced to ask ourselves the question "where do we feel the most at home?” and the answer was clear - Bali.&nbsp;

We have been here for 3 months now and we couldn’t be happier about our decision. Although there have been a lot of changes on the island, we love this place and we love how the locals and foreigners combined have handled the difficult situation we all find ourselves in.

How has Bali faired compared to the rest of the world? Has this peaceful island turned into chaos? We know that a lot of you had to cancel your travel plans to come here and are probably wondering when you might be able to return.

So in this post, we want to share our observations with you of how life here in Bali has changed and give you information direct from the authorities.

### What has changed in Bali during the quarantine

* Indonesian authorities issued public guidelines where they asked everybody to stay home as much as possible. We can go outside for groceries, to the pharmacy, and in case of an emergency.
* The people are still happy and positive
* There has been no panic what so ever, no rushes to supermarkets etc
* If we need to go outside we have to wear masks at all times.&nbsp;
* Most of the cafes, bars, and restaurants were closed but since a few days ago some of them start to slowly open back up again.
* Take-away and delivery have been excellent with GO-JEK.
* All sights, beaches, gyms, SPA’s on the island are closed until the end of May.
* No toilet paper shortages
* All airports and seaports are closed until the 1st of June and the government might extend it in case of an increase of new COVID-19 cases.&nbsp;
* The streets are very quiet, there is no traffic and you can see very few people outside.
* There are no Visas On Arrival being issued at the moment.
* The government has granted emergency visas until the lock-down is over to all those who didn’t manage to return to their home countries on time.&nbsp;

Those who are here are either locals or foreigners who permanently live in Bali. We don't know when Bali will be open for tourism again. One thing is clear, the longer borders stay closed the more difficult it will be for the island to recover.&nbsp;
