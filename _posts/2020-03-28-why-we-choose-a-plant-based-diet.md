  <p>The two most pivotal and life changing days in our lives,</p><p>&nbsp;1)
  The day we met each other</p><p>2) The day we decided to commit to a whole
  plant based lifestyle</p><p>This statement might seem like a bit of a stretch
  but it is 100 percent the truth. Without going to much into the science and
  the statistics, we want to go over some of the reasons why we decided to
  choose this lifestyle and why this decision changed our lives forever for the
  better.&nbsp;</p>

      What you put in your body over your lifetime will have a far greater
      impact on your physical and mental health than anything else you do in
      this life

      <p>Three years ago when I (Jake) was completing my divemaster in Honduras
      I learnt a fact that changed my life forever. During a theory lesson about
      the declining state of coral reefs I learnt that the greatest cause of
      ocean dead zones was pollution from factory farms producing beef. All of a
      sudden my mind made a connection &lsquo;if I am paying for and eating
      beef, I am paying for the destruction of my favourite place, the
      ocean&rsquo;</p><p>Making this connection kicked off a whirlwind of
      learning and discovery. I started researching, reading articles, scouring
      through studies, watching documentaries. The information I was processing
      blew my mind. I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking &lsquo;how did I not know
      this&rsquo;. The impact our diet had on the environment, the cruelty our
      dollars were supporting, the implications our western diet had on our
      health. It all started to sink in!&nbsp;</p><p>Having all this knowledge
      meant I couldn&rsquo;t keep my head in the sand anymore. I knew that
      saying I loved animals and eating them was a complete contradiction. I
      knew that caring for the environment but choosing to eat the products that
      caused the most destruction made no sense.&nbsp;</p><p>It became clear to
      me that no taste, no pleasure, no personal satisfaction would ever be
      worth the devastation and cruelty that comes attached to all animal
      products. Now I know for certain after 2.5 years of aligning my actions
      with my beliefs and only eating whole plant based food, not only do humans
      survive on a plant based diet, we THRIVE! The pleasure, taste and personal
      satisfaction I now receive through my food choices far outweighs anything
      I had previously experienced before. If there is one thing I know for
      certain, it is that I will never go back.</p><h4>MARIE'S JOURNEY TO PLANT
      BASED LIVING</h4><p>When we first met, Jake was already plant-based. It
      wasn&rsquo;t really something we talked about a lot initially. It
      definitely wasn&rsquo;t something Jake tried to force onto me. I was
      curious as to why this hairy Aussie guy wouldn&rsquo;t eat
      meat.&nbsp;</p><p>The more we talked about it and the more I learnt
      through documentaries and books, the more I started to become aware of the
      negative side effects animal products have on our health and the
      environment. I started making connections in my own life, I realised that
      neglecting proper nutrition had caused so much pain and suffering for
      myself and my family. My father had a long battle with cancer. I never
      considered that maybe it wasn&rsquo;t genetics, or just bad luck that
      caused my Father&rsquo;s cancer. The link between diet and disease is
      something that most people don&rsquo;t give enough thought and I decided I
      wasn&rsquo;t going to be one of those people anymore. I decided to commit
      to learning more about plant based nutrition and i&rsquo;ve never looked
      back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4>WHY DO WE DO IT?</h4><p>What you put in your body
      over your lifetime will have a far greater impact on your physical and
      mental health than anything else you do in this life. It is crazy to think
      that in all 1st world countries, most of the major causes of death are
      related to lifestyle diseases! We are eating ourselves to death while
      people in 3rd world countries are starving to death.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t
      mean to shock you by saying this, we just want you to understand that
      learning and uncovering the truth about your food choices (in particular
      the negative effects animal products have on your health) could literally
      save your life, or the lives of those people you love the most.</p><p>The
      human body has no need for animal products and no need for processed food.
      There are many societies around the world that are living proof of this
      fact. Now disease and sickness has become something we just accept. Heart
      attacks, strokes, cancer, diabetes, depression and obesity are becoming so
      common that every single one of us has been effected either directly or
      indirectly by at least one of these diseases.</p><p>It&rsquo;s easier to
      imagine that it&rsquo;s just luck, or its bad genetics. Its harder to
      accept that some of your favourite foods have become some of your worst
      addictions and the only way to becoming a more energetic, youthful and
      healthier version of yourself is to give them up.</p><p>Once we had
      learned that a plant based diet was not only healthy, but the healthiest
      way to eat. We made a realisation that the choice to eat the food that
      caused the most destruction and suffering, was a choice of conditioning
      and pleasure rather than a choice of necessity. We didn&rsquo;t need
      animal products to be healthy.</p><p>So then it became a choice for us,
      was pleasuring our taste buds more important than an animals life or more
      important than keeping our world healthy for future generations. The
      answer for us was No, it might be yes for some of you. Whatever you
      believe right now, it is important to think consciously about your
      choices. Does the end result of your choices truly reflect what you
      believe?</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2>
