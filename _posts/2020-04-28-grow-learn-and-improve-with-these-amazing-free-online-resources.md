  <p>We all have so much free time right now. If you&rsquo;re anything like us
  you&rsquo;ve most likely been thinking about ways you can use this time
  effectively to learn, grow, and prepare so that you can re-enter the world a
  bigger, better version of yourself with a whole new toolkit of skills and
  knowledge. I think most of us like the sound of that but it's easier said than
  done. Between scrolling through our feeds, getting caught up in news updates,
  and binge-watching new shows on Netflix. It really is hard to focus on growth
  in this time of uncertainty.</p><p>But just think about this for a moment.
  Never has there been a situation where you have more time and more freedom to
  immerse yourself in what you have always wanted to do. You could start your
  new business, build your own website, record your first youtube videos, learn
  a new language, write your first book. And the craziest thing is, you will be
  making leaps and bounds forward while the rest of the world is in a
  standstill. You will blow away your competition and when you re-enter the
  world after all this is over, you could be in a better position than when it
  all started.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, we have compiled a list of our
  favourite FREE resources that will teach you a lot and help you become a
  better version of yourself. Some of the information in these resources will
  change your life! No kidding!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><strong>What happens to your body when you
      fast?</strong></h4><p>Something amazing happens to your body when you
      fast. Instead of using glucose for energy, your body switches to a process
      called ketogenesis. It starts burning fat, producing ketones that are used
      for energy. When we start using ketones for energy instead of glucose, it
      can actually enhance our physical and mental endurance and reboot a
      sluggish metabolism.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What are the benefits of
      intermittent fasting?</strong></h4><p>Before we get into the
      scientifically proven benefits I will speak about the benefits we have
      personally noticed in ourselves.</p><ul><li>Our energy and focus has
      greatly improved, especially in the morning</li><li>Our muscles feel less
      sore after workouts</li><li>We need to workout a lot less to stay in great
      shape</li><li>We rarely ever feel bloated</li><li>We feel more in tune
      with our bodies and what they really need</li></ul><p>Here&rsquo;s some of
      the benefits of intermittent fasting research has
      observed:</p><ul><li>Increased weight loss</li><li>Improves memory,
      cognitive function, and clarity of mind</li><li>Gives you more
      energy</li><li>Has anti-inflammatory effects</li><li>Has anti-aging
      effects and helps to heal the body on a cellular level</li><li>Protects
      against chronic disease like diabetes and cardiovascular disease</li></ul>

      <h4><strong>Tips for intermittent fasting and what you can do to help
      yourself get through</strong></h4><p>Once you fall into the rhythm of an
      intermittent fasting lifestyle, you will realise it&rsquo;s not that
      difficult to stick to. It will become a natural way for you to eat. If you
      feel the need you can drink black coffee with no milk and no sugar or
      herbal tea. You can also try apple cider vinegar in the morning which
      helps with digestion and doesn&rsquo;t break your fast.&nbsp;</p><p>We
      also make sure to never consume any calories after 8.30pm. It means that
      the latest we ever eat the next day is 12.30pm. And while we are on the
      topic of the fasting window, don&rsquo;t be so strict that you&rsquo;re
      constantly watching the clock. If you have fasted for 15 hours and you
      need to eat before you go out, then eat. If you know you will be out all
      day and you only have one opportunity to eat some food in the morning,
      have a bite to eat.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only are there multiple
      scientifically-proven benefits including anti-aging effects and increased
      weight loss. It is a lesson in will power and a way for us to break the
      control food has over our mood and the way we spend our time. It has
      improved our lives in many ways and we believe it can do the same for you
      if you give it a chance.</p><p>Subscribe to our <strong><a
      href="/subscribe">newsletter</a></strong> where we will share with you the
      best resources we have found on the topic including podcasts, articles,
      and books from experts in the field.</p><p><u>Let us know in the comments
      below if you have any questions about our journey or our thoughts on
      intermittent fasting. Please share with everyone else your experience with
      intermittent fasting if you have tried.&nbsp;</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
