  <p>We all have so much free time right now. If you&rsquo;re anything like us
  you&rsquo;ve most likely been thinking about ways you can use this time
  effectively to learn, grow, and prepare so that you can re-enter the world a
  bigger, better version of yourself with a whole new toolkit of skills and
  knowledge. I think most of us like the sound of that but it's easier said than
  done. Between scrolling through our feeds, getting caught up in news updates,
  and binge-watching new shows on Netflix. It really is hard to focus on growth
  in this time of uncertainty.</p><p>But just think about this for a moment.
  Never has there been a situation where you have more time and more freedom to
  immerse yourself in what you have always wanted to do. You could start your
  new business, build your own website, record your first youtube videos, learn
  a new language, write your first book. And the craziest thing is, you will be
  making leaps and bounds forward while the rest of the world is in a
  standstill. You will blow away your competition and when you re-enter the
  world after all this is over, you could be in a better position than when it
  all started.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, we have compiled a list of our
  favourite FREE resources that will teach you a lot and help you become a
  better version of yourself. Some of the information in these resources will
  change your life! No kidding!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
