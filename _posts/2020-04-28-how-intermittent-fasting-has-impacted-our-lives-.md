title: How Intermittent Fasting has impacted our lives.
meta-description: >-
  we didn’t start intermittent fasting 2 years ago because we thought it would
  be fun. We gave it a try because there were several studies at the time that
  highlighted a lot of potential benefits and in our minds it only made sense
  that if our bodies were constantly using up energy to digest food, then that
  energy could never be focused on other important bodily functions like muscle
  & cell repair, memory retention, flushing out toxins etc.

  <p>When people ask us &lsquo;what&rsquo;s your secret? How do you stay in
  shape and stay healthy while travelling the world with minimal to no
  routine?&rsquo; Our answer is, we don&rsquo;t have a secret but we have been
  eating a whole plant-based diet for 5 years and we&rsquo;ve been intermittent
  fasting for 2 years. If we had to try to assess the effect these two factors
  have on our overall health, we would attribute around 80% of the reason we
  feel so healthy and energized to these two lifestyle choices!</p><p>Of course,
  this is our opinion on how we feel, but we didn&rsquo;t start intermittent
  fasting 2 years ago because we thought it would be fun. We gave it a try

  benefits. In our minds it only made sense that if our bodies were constantly
  using up energy to digest food, then that energy could never be focused on
  other important bodily functions like muscle &amp; cell repair, memory
  retention, flushing out toxins etc.</p><p>But can intermittent fasting really
  become part of a healthy eating plan for you? Isn&rsquo;t intermittent fasting
  the diet where you need to starve yourself for hours on end? This is not what
  fasting is. To be clear we do not strictly watch the clock every single day
  and start eating the minute we hit 16 hours fasted. Marie will fast on around
  50% of days while I&rsquo;ll fast on most.&nbsp;</p><p>When people ask us

    body-content_html: >-
      <h4><strong><em>What is intermittent fasting?</em></strong></h4><p>Fasting
      and starvation are not the same things. Fasting is voluntary abstaining or
      partly abstaining from food for a certain period of time. Our nomadic
      ancestors lived like this for thousands of years. Even today, religious
      groups like Muslims, Christians, and Buddhist monks practice
      fasting.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong><em>How do you do intermittent
      fasting?</em></strong></h4><p>When you do intermittent fasting, you cycle
      through periods of eating (called the eating window) and periods of not
      eating. The most popular intermittent fasting plan out there is the 16:8
      plan.</p><p>On the 16:8 plan, your eating window during the day is 8
      hours, where after you don&rsquo;t eat for 16 hours. For example if you
      eat your dinner at 8pm then your next meal will be at 12noon the next day
      for a 16 hour fast. If you are really looking to optimise your health and
      lose some weight, it&rsquo;s a good idea to eat a healthy whole
      plant-based diet. Fill your meals with fresh fruits and vegetables during
      your eating window. Combining both a whole plant-based diet and
      intermittent fasting is where we believe the magic results appear.
      Remember, if you consume any form of calories within your fasting window
      it will break the fast. Your stomach will start the digestion process and
      you will not reap the benefits of being in a fasting state.</p><p>In the
      beginning, it can be hard to adjust and you might find yourself a bit
      irritable and hungry in the morning. In our experience, it took about one
      month to become used to being fasted in the morning. Now it is a part of
      our everyday life and we even do full workouts having not eaten for over
      12-14 hours.</p>
