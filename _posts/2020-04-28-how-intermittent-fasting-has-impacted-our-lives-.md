title: How Intermittent Fasting has impacted our lives.
meta-description: >-
  we didn’t start intermittent fasting 2 years ago because we thought it would
  be fun. We gave it a try because there were several studies at the time that
  highlighted a lot of potential benefits and in our minds it only made sense
  that if our bodies were constantly using up energy to digest food, then that
  energy could never be focused on other important bodily functions like muscle
  & cell repair, memory retention, flushing out toxins etc.

  <p>When people ask us &lsquo;what&rsquo;s your secret? How do you stay in
  shape and stay healthy while travelling the world with minimal to no
  routine?&rsquo; Our answer is, we don&rsquo;t have a secret but we have been
  eating a whole plant-based diet for 5 years and we&rsquo;ve been intermittent
  fasting for 2 years. If we had to try to assess the effect these two factors
  have on our overall health, we would attribute around 80% of the reason we
  feel so healthy and energized to these two lifestyle choices!</p><p>Of course,
  this is our opinion on how we feel, but we didn&rsquo;t start intermittent
  fasting 2 years ago because we thought it would be fun. We gave it a try
  because there were several studies that highlighted a lot of potential
  benefits. In our minds it only made sense that if our bodies were constantly
  using up energy to digest food, then that energy could never be focused on
  other important bodily functions like muscle &amp; cell repair, memory
  retention, flushing out toxins etc.</p><p>But can intermittent fasting really
  become part of a healthy eating plan for you? Isn&rsquo;t intermittent fasting
  the diet where you need to starve yourself for hours on end? This is not what
  fasting is. To be clear we do not strictly watch the clock every single day
  and start eating the minute we hit 16 hours fasted. Marie will fast on around
  50% of days while I&rsquo;ll fast on most.&nbsp;</p><p>When people ask us

    main-paragraph-emphasis: Take a social media timeout to avoid cluttering your mind
    body-content_html: >-
      <ol><li><strong>Follow the rules of the country you are currently
      in</strong> for your own safety and those around you.</li><li><strong>Take
      a step back and turn your situation positive.</strong> Allowing negative
      emotions to fester because you are feeling upset or pressured can affect
      your mental health and productivity. Creating positive affirmations like
      &lsquo;I will get through this&rsquo; can make a big
      difference.</li><li><strong>Stick with your normal routine the best you
      can.</strong> Example: don&rsquo;t go into a panic because you cannot go
      to the gym anymore. Find a home exercise alternative and stick to your
      routine, this will help you to stay calm and
      productive.</li><li><strong>Reach out to loved ones.</strong> Now is a
      good time to say those things you need to say. You never know, the other
      person might just be needing your support more than you
      realise.</li><li><strong>Take a social media timeout </strong>to avoid
      cluttering your mind with inflated panic. Choose one valid resource to get
      your coronavirus information from and only allow yourself to check it once
      a day. If you feel the itch to check your socials more, look at a funny
      cat video instead.</li><li><strong>Make a &lsquo;worry-list&rsquo;
      </strong>about what is freaking you out because of the virus. Writing it
      down and meditating over it will most likely have you realise you are
      overreacting and give you possible solutions to your
      worries.</li><li><strong>Create new healthy habits.</strong> Do more yoga
      self-practice, eat more vitamin-loaded fruits and vegetables, sleep more.
      These are good habits to improve not only your immune system but your
      overall health.</li><li><strong>Practice meditation and
      mindfulness</strong> with positive affirmations to keep yourself calm and
      productive during a crisis.</li><li><strong>Be grateful</strong> for what
      you have and realise that it is probably
      enough.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t be selfish </strong>and panic buy.
      Leave some for everyone.</li></ol><p>It is important to stay true to
      yourself during this time and not get lost in the sea of over-information
      and crisis. If you can anchor yourself, stay calm and positive, you can
      become a support anchor for those in your immediate community. Positivity,
      just like panic, can be contagious, and once it takes flight it&rsquo;s
      hard to stop.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
