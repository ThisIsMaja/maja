intro-paragraph-emphasis: THE WAY I SEE IT...
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>Hi I'm Vennessa. I'm from the beautiful island of Jamaica. Like a lot of
  other families;&nbsp; my family migrated to the USA for a better life.
  Entering America I pursued a career as a Registered Nurse. While being a Nurse
  I got to experience a lot of different cultures and decided to take on the
  task of being a travel blogger. With a curious mind, it was no surprise to my
  family when I took on the journey to explore the world; whilst caring and
  helping people along the way. My goal is to inspire as many people as I can so
  they too will want to explore this beautiful world we get to call home.</p>

      A lot of POC across the world come from families that did not have the
      opportunity to explore the world

      <h2>TRAVELING WHILE BLACK</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With the recent events
      happening in the United States and across the world. I feel the need to
      talk about racial disparities in the travel industry.&nbsp;</p><p>In
      recent years I realized that racial disparities had been rooted in us for
      generations. As a brief history; international travel had been viewed as a
      type of privilege that is generally not associated with people of color
      (POC). A lot of POC across the world come from families that did not have
      the opportunity to explore the world. Instead their families were focused
      on fighting for basic rights. Within the United States many POC&nbsp;
      were&nbsp; immigrants whose priorities were focused on starting and
      creating a better life for their families. This lack of exposure to travel
      in the past has helped create a lower number of black people traveling,
      and so the idea of traveling internationally became associated with white
      privilege.</p>

    body-content_html: >-
      <p>Nowadays people are drawn to social media. As such, influencers came
      about and they started using social media as a platform to express
      themselves. Being a black travel blogger and being able to go abroad my
      hope was that I could share my travel experience with a wide audience of
      POC so that they would be inspired to do the same. For instance, a
      beautiful picture of me enjoying a view of the Indian ocean miles away
      from home in hope that it may inspire a young person of color to work
      towards sharing that same experience one day.</p><p>The travel community
      likes to think of itself as a space of pure bliss, a tropical paradise, an
      escape to a place of only fun and leisure where things such as racism have
      no place. In truth as a black traveler or individual of color there is no
      such thing as an escape from racism by going on vacation. Racism does not
      go away for us; it is a constant battle. From being racially profiled in a
      foreign land to even airports by airline companies that say they are built
      on diversity. I have been personally asked to be searched and was
      blatantly told it was because I am black. So like any other part of
      society, racism has been built into the travel industry both consciously
      and unconsciously.</p>

      A lot of black people from the travel industry have voiced their concerns
      about the big pay gap between white travel bloggers and black travel
      bloggers
    body-content_html: >-
      <p>Starting out as a travel content creator is hard in itself. The roots
      of racism make it even harder. As black travelers we are less likely to be
      featured on travel accounts supported by non-black owners, less likely to
      be asked to speak on panels, take part in campaigns, represent brands or
      companies, this causes less exposure for black travelers and creates a
      close niche between white bloggers. Some resorts won&rsquo;t even accept
      black travel bloggers for paid partnerships because of the color of our
      skin and the texture of our hair because it does not meet their beauty
      standards. This exclusion leads to less pay and far fewer opportunities. A
      lot of black people from the travel industry have voiced their concerns
      about the big pay gap between white travel bloggers and black travel
      bloggers, and many companies have yet to acknowledge or do anything about
      it. They are so uncomfortable about the topic that they are quick to
      dismiss that there is even such an issue. So as a black travel blogger you
      have to work twice as hard to get only HALF of what others have.</p>

      <p>Traveling while black means you might be encountered by people who have
      never seen black people. People will try to touch your hair, even try to
      photograph or just stare at you as if you are on display. It can become
      uncomfortable because their depiction of us is only based on what is
      negatively shown on the media and you don't know if they are staring at
      you because of pure interest or contempt. Many times as a black traveler
      you might be the only black person in a resort and sometimes people can be
      rude; they will ask you which room you are staying at, to see if it is a
      luxurious room versus a room on the cheap end or even asks you how you are
      able to afford travel as if it is impossible to be successful as a black
      person.</p><p>As this black lives movement tries their hardest to oust
      racism in the justice system. The travel industry should do their part to
      topple racism. Instead of trying to negate that racism exists in the
      industry, start by accepting that it is present within the travel industry
      and know that this is a fight that you are not fighting alone. We can all
      learn from each other as we all live unique lives. No matter your skin
      color, we all have a part to contribute to society.</p>
