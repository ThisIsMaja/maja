  We get asked a lot about how we manage our time and projects, how we stay
  creative and healthy and how we are able to do it all with relative ease.

  <p>We live in a time where we have almost unlimited access to tools and
  resources but we also have unlimited access to every distraction you can
  imagine. We get asked a lot about how we manage our time and projects, how we
  stay creative and healthy and how we are able to do it all with relative
  ease.</p><p>Well to be honest it's not always easy, but you can make
  everything easier for yourself by making use of tools like apps that are
  designed to help you be more productive, more creative, more healthy and just
  overall make your life easier.</p><p>In this post we will talk specifically
  about various app&rsquo;s we use weekly if not daily. Some of them help to
  make our lives easier by saving us time, others are for fun and entertainment
  that help us let go.</p><p>Our 17 must-have apps are grouped in four
  categories: lifehack apps, productivity &amp; time management apps, learning
  &amp; fun apps, and health apps.&nbsp;</p>

      <h1><strong>BALI BERRY SMOOTHIE BOWL</strong></h1><p><strong>Makes
      1</strong></p><p><strong>INGREDIENTS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>1&frasl;2 cup
      frozen mixed berries&nbsp;</p><p>50g frozen dragonfruit</p><p>1 large
      banana, frozen</p><p>50g mango, frozen&nbsp;</p><p>1&frasl;4 cup
      plant-based milk or coconut water</p><p>1 tablespoon chia seeds or any of
      your favourite
      superfoods&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GARNISH&nbsp;</strong></p><p>1&frasl;2
      cup Granola</p><p>2 strawberries, sliced</p><p>1 banana, sliced</p><p>1
      tablespoons coconut flakes&nbsp;</p><p>1&frasl;2 mango, big thick
      slices</p><p>1 sprig
      mint&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>METHOD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Blend
      together all smoothie ingredients. Remember to slowly add the liquid and
      only as much as needed. It is easier to put more in than take it out, and
      the texture of the smoothie bowl is the most important
      part.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now for the mango letters, you need to cut
      your mango into 1/2cm thick slices. Using your letter cutters, select
      which word you are going to use and cut away. It can take a few times to
      perfect, so be patient.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TO
      SERVE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Spread a layer of granola on top of your
      smoothie, this will help to make a base for your garnish. Top with sliced
      banana, strawberries, coconut flakes, chia, mint leaves and your mango
      letters.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h1><strong>BALI BANANA PANCAKES</strong></h1><p>Serves
      2</p><p><strong>INGREDIENTS:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CARAMEL
      SAUCE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>1 cup coconut cream</p><p>3&frasl;4 cup brown
      sugar</p><p>Pinch salt</p><p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
      (optional)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PANCAKES&nbsp;</strong></p><p>2
      tablespoons Vegan butter, melted</p><p>1 1&frasl;2 cups all-purpose
      flour</p><p>2 cups soy milk or any plant-based milk&nbsp;</p><p>1 teaspoon
      baking powder&nbsp;</p><p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract&nbsp;</p><p>2.5
      tablespoons white or brown sugar&nbsp;</p><p>Coconut oil or extra Vegan
      butter, to coat pan</p><p>2
      bananas</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>METHOD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For the
      caramel sauce, use a small pot or pan and mix together all ingredients.
      Heat on medium-high heat, stirring consistently. Once the mixture is
      bubbling, reduce the heat and simmer for approx. 5 minutes or until the
      mixture starts to thicken.&nbsp; Note: The sauce will thicken most when
      cooled. You can use the caramel sauce straight away or allow to cool and
      store in the fridge for around 1 week.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To make
      pancakes, first melt the butter, then mix together with the flour, milk,
      baking powder, vanilla extract and sugar in a bowl. If your mixture is too
      thick, add a little more milk until you get the desired consistency. It
      shouldn&rsquo;t be too thick or too thin. You want a consistency similar
      to cream.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Heat your non-stick frypan and use
      coconut oil or butter to coat your pan. Pour approx. 1&frasl;2 cup of the
      mixture into the pan and swirl around to get a bigger pancake. Thinly
      slice a banana long ways and place the banana onto the pancake as
      it&rsquo;s cooking.&nbsp;</p><p>Wait for the bubbles to appear in the
      pancake and flip it over.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TO
      SERVE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Garnish with strawberries, caramel sauce and
      shredded coconut.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are short on time skip the caramel
      sauce and use maple syrup.</p>

      website that curates articles for you based on what you
      like.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Every morning Marie likes to spend 15-20 minutes
      reading either a book or an article. And if it is an article than for sure
      she will be reading it on Medium. Marie has been using it for so long that
      the app knows exactly what kind of content she is interested in, so she
      doesn't have to search for it. It makes reading so easy and saves a lot of
      time, which is crucial for us, especially in the
      morning.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a target="_blank"

      English is very good but in times when she can&rsquo;t remember a word she
      will quickly translate it from German via this app. Just something that is

      environment a lot.</p><ul><li>Audible - <a target="_blank"

      href="https://thisismaja.com/posts/15-books-to-read-during-isolation"><u>15
      books to read during self-isolation</u></a> and you all seemed to like it
      as well. In the situations when you can't be reading a physical book, such
      as cooking or driving, audio books are a great solution. A lot of times
      the author will read a book himself and we find it so much more personal
      this way. Audible has a free trial, so if you haven't used it yet you
      might want to give it a go.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a target="_blank"

      social media where people share short videos</li></ul><p>TikTok has become
      very popular in the past year and we have been loving to play with it. We
      upload loads of snippets from our travels there. Some of them are more
      cinematic and some are just us goofing around. We also love to watch other
      creators on there. Just make sure to not lose a track of time while you
      are there. That has definitely happened to us a few
      times.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Spotify - Our go-to app for music and podcasts. A

      Headspace is a great tool to help with that. It has guided meditations for

      practice. You can start with 3 minutes and slowly build it up from there.
      You can also track your sleep cycle and practice mindfulness. To help
