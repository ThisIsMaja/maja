  <h1>Adapting to the new normal</h1><p>A few months ago we published a blog
  post with a <a href="https://thisismaja.com/posts/maja-travel-update">travel
  update</a> and our view on the future of travel. What we previously considered
  a temporary inconvenience has slowly become the new normal. Having a mask with
  you at all times became a habit. Now, before leaving the house, you check at
  least four things in your mind - keys, wallet, phone, and mask. Keeping
  distance while standing in line or when using public transport has also become
  second nature.</p><p>Some countries are hit harder than others, so
  governmental guidelines and regulations will also vary per country. Despite
  all that, there is only one way that we can all move forward - adapt. We have
  adapted to the new way we behave in public, our work routine has most probably
  changed as well, and so has the way we travel.</p>

      <h2>Tourism industry in 2020 compared to 2019</h2><p>Before we share the
      list of safe travel alternatives we want to have a look at the statistics.
      Let&rsquo;s see how the travel industry has changed in 2020 compared to
      2019 and why it is important to continue travelling.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019
      tourism made up 10% of global GDP, which is three times larger than the
      agriculture sector. You can imagine how big and important the tourism
      industry is for the global economy.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the data from
      www.statista.com, there is a decrease of around 35% in the global revenue
      for the travel and tourism industry in 2020.</p><p><img

      <h2>Information in Numbers</h2><ul><li>The global travel and tourism
      market is expected to see a loss of 100.8 million jobs worldwide in
      2020.</li><li>The Asia Pacific region is the one to suffer the most in
      terms of job loss. Around 63.5 million people lost their
      jobs.&nbsp;</li><li>Europe is forecast to be the second hardest hit with a
      forecasted employment drop of 13 million.</li><li>The overall economic
      damage is likely to exceed $1 trillion in 2020.</li><li>Europe will be the
      most affected, with a 50% decrease in revenue in 2020 compared to
      2019.</li><li>Tourism spending is likely to return to the pre-crisis level
      not sooner than by 2024, which again puts as many as 100 million jobs at
      risk.</li><li>The World Tourism Organisation said that the drop in tourist
      spending will set the global tourism industry back by 20 years.</li><li>In
      June, IATA estimated that airline revenues will be down at least 50% ($419
      billion compared to $838 billion in 2019).</li></ul><p><img width="771"

      <p>As you can see from the numbers above, it is extremely important to
      find a middle ground between people staying safe and reviving the tourism
      industry. Finding ways for people to safely enjoy travelling again could
      provide a lifeline to millions of people. It is good to remember that no
      matter what type of travelling you choose it is important to be
      responsible and to always think smart. We have written a separate blog
      post about <a href="https://thisismaja.com/posts/responsible-tourist"><u>5
      ways to be a responsible tourist</u></a>, so make sure to check it
      out.&nbsp;</p><p>Each country is taking its approach to border controls
      and health regulations. But reopening a tourist economy is something that
      is crucial to the European and world economy.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides the not
      so positive stats, there is another reason why we need to continue
      traveling. Traveling helps people to experience different customs and
      cultures. This is what builds empathy and acceptance for people that are
      different to ourselves. Traveling educates us like no book will ever be
      able to. It allows us to experience new smells, new flavors, and new
      sounds. It puts us outside of our comfort zone and opens up new
      possibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Putting all that together I think we can
      all agree that travelling is an important part of our lives. Therefore, we
      would like to share with you 6 ways of how you can do it safely.</p>

      <h2>6 Ways to travel safely</h2><h3>1. Travelling with a motorhome
      (RV)</h3><p>It is ideal to avoid crowds and airports. You can control your
      environment while still enjoying nature. Besides that, it is cheaper than
      an average hotel holiday. Marie and I drove our RV from Germany to
      Portugal and we spent around 100-110 Euros a day on gas and campsites.
      There are plenty of different apps where you can find free camping grounds
      or for just about 10-30 Euros per night including
      facilities.</p><p>Another advantage is that you can bring all your
      essentials with you and you have full control of your agenda. With an RV
      you can travel as close or as far from your home as you want. Some of the
      bigger RV&rsquo;s include fully functioning bathrooms and
      kitchens.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are considering renting an RV read this blog
      post about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://thisismaja.com/posts/living-the-van-life">7 advantages of
      living a van life</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Camping</h3><p>If you are not a fan
      of long road trips and would rather stay at one place, camping might be a
      good alternative for you. To make camping more fun you can bring a
      mountain bicycle, a badminton set, gear for water sports, playing cards
      and different table games. All this will help to diversify your days and
      if you are not camping alone, you will have a great bonding experience
      with your friend or a partner. Camping is also a good opportunity for a
      digital detox, as the connection is usually not that great. Use this time
      to connect with yourself, find your balance and recharge your
      batteries.</p><h3>3. Cabin rental</h3><p>To add even more comfort to your
      travels you can take it a step further and rent a cute little cabin in the
      woods. You can have all the same benefits as camping but including hot
      water and a flush down WC. Have a quick search online and we are sure you
      will find a couple of great options in your area.</p>

      <h3>4. Road trips</h3><p>Somehow when we think of our next holiday our
      mind automatically goes to a foreign destination. But how often do we
      travel domestically? Take this as an opportunity to start exploring your
      own country. Take more weekend trips, take a car and go to a place you
      didn&rsquo;t know about or never thought of visiting. We are sure you will
      be pleasantly surprised. And if you decide to make it an overnight trip
      maybe consider renting a cabin just outside of the city to avoid
      crowds.</p><h3>5. Villa rental</h3><p>For a more luxurious experience
      instead of going to a hotel consider renting a private villa. This might
      not be as cheap as staying in a hotel but it will be
      safer.&nbsp;</p><h3>6. Remote hotels &amp; AirBnb</h3><p>If a hotel is
      your best and possibly the only option then try to find a remote hotel
      further away from the popular touristy destination. Hotels and AirBnbs had
      to adapt their cleaning procedures to comply with the new standards. You
      can find this information on the official website of the property you are
      considering staying in.</p><p>Keeping all this in mind we are sure that we
      can slowly revive the tourism industry and help restart safe travelling
      again.&nbsp;</p><p>Have you done any travel this year? Tell us how does
      travelling in your country look like nowadays? What has changed?</p>
