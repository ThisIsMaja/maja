intro-paragraph-emphasis: Midway through 2018 I finally decided to get off the pill once and for all
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>From the moment I made that decision I have been fighting a constant battle
  to rebalance my hormones and regain the healthy skin I once had. It has been a
  tiring process and I almost gave in several times to the allure of clean skin
  by manipulating my hormones with the &lsquo;pill&rsquo;. In this blog post I'm
  not going to talk about why the pill is bad for you or why I decided to quit.
  At this point I just want to share with you how I succeeded at rebalancing my
  hormones and how I brought my skin back under control.</p><p>This is for all
  you girls out there who want to get off the pill but you have struggled with
  skin issues every time you try. I want you to believe there is a way for you
  to regain your healthy skin and say goodbye to the horrible pill for good. I
  can tell you now with patience and commitment you can do it. And I am
  confident that with the right information and learning from my mistakes you
  can do it much quicker.&nbsp;</p><p>It for sure hasn&rsquo;t been easy and
  I've tried almost every treatment you can think of. From different diets,
  medications and home remedies to staying out of the sun or covering my face in
  apple cider vinegar. I tried it all and I finally found a remedy for me. Now I
  know what I need to do to control my skin, but that doesn't mean my skin is
  always perfect. It just means that I know why my skin goes bad when it does,
  and I know how to fix it.</p><p>If you struggle with any sort of skin issue
  you really need to ask yourself WHY!! What does my skin want to tell me here?
  The skin is our biggest organ and holds 20% of our natural bacteria in it and
  on it, this bacteria gets fed by the other 80% of our bacteria in our gut. The
  skin is the window to our inner health and is also an organ that releases a
  lot of our toxins. So if there is something wrong with your skin, ask yourself
  - what could be the tigger??</p><p>Do I have too much physical or mental
  stress right now, how good is my sleep, am I drinking enough, do I drink
  alcohol or smoke, what do I eat?? These are the questions we need to ask
  ourselves. I know life sometimes isn't fair and there are girls out there who
  have great skin while eating whatever they want. But that does not mean they
  are healthy. They might even be still taking the birth control pill which
  helps with your skin but causes a lot of harm to your body.</p>

      <h4><strong>How I healed my skin after coming off the
      pill</strong></h4><p>The first thing I would suggest if you&rsquo;re
      wanting to come off the pill or if you&rsquo;re already trying, is to go
      and get a complete blood test. The results will let you know if you are
      deficient in any nutrients or if you have other conditions that need to be
      taken care of that might affect or be affecting your skin.</p><p>After a
      couple months of being off the pill I also recommend you get a hormone
      test to gauge how your hormones are balancing out.</p><p>Now if
      you&rsquo;re anything like me I know you&rsquo;re serious about taking
      back control of your hormones and just overall becoming more in tune with
      your true self. So I'm going to jump right into the most effective
      solution that I found to heal my skin and rebalance my internal system. It
      is not an easy solution and it takes willpower to stick to it but it will
      change everything if you can.&nbsp;</p><h4
      id="the-veganpescatarian-candida-diet">The vegan/pescatarian candida
      diet&nbsp;</h4><p>I got on this diet to try and heal my all my fungus
      diseases (my <strong><a
      href="https://www.nutriplanet.org/2018/08/candida-overgrowth-guide/">candida</a>,&nbsp;</strong>the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>acne
      on my face &amp; white spots on my back called <strong><a
      href="https://www.healthline.com/health/tinea-versicolor">tinea
      versicolour</a></strong>). The white spots Ive lived with for almost 15
      years. This diet healed all my skin conditions when I was 100% strict with
      it. No more acne or pimples anywhere. However when I do not take 100% care
      of myself (bad diet, stress, sweaty clothes, bad sleep) my skin tells me
      right away. I have it much better under control but it is fair to say: In
      order to have amazing skin you have to work on yourself. It is an ongoing
      process.</p><p>From the results I got from being on this diet, I learnt
      that the health of my skin has a direct correlation to the health of my
      gut environment. Overtime from taking too many anti-inflammatories,
      drinking alcohol and eating processed/sugary and fried foods, I developed
      an unhealthy gut environment. An unhealthy gut is the perfect breeding
      ground for bacteria and fungus that can have a really damaging effect on
      your skin. Before you can take back control of your skin you need to
      create a healthy gut environment and I believe the best and most effective
      way to do this is to go on a strict vegan/pescatarian candida diet. I am
      going to link a great article about what this diet includes and some
      recipes for you <a
      href="https://www.thecandidadiet.com/candida-diet-vegan-vegetarian/"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a>!</p><p>Essentially
      a <strong><a href="https://www.nutriplanet.org">vegan/pescatarian candida
      diet</a></strong> is a diet that restricts all processed food and all
      refined sugars/carbs. I was shocked that I wasn't allowed to eat fruit,
      even the sugar in fruit was feeding the bad bacteria in my gut. I was also
      shocked that after 2 years of being vegan and eating predominantly whole
      foods, my gut wasn't healthy already. The problem is sugar! Once you have
      bad bacteria in your gut it can survive for years even on a really healthy
      diet. All the bad bacteria needs is some white bread or a bit of pasta or
      pizza or some coconut ice cream and it will stay with you.</p><p>I wish I
      could say that you can have a cheat meal here and there, or eating a
      sugary dessert once a week is ok. But what I found was that as soon as I
      made one mistake and ate something I shouldn't have, my skin would flair
      up right away and I would need to start again from the
      beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>I am so confident that if you can stick to a full
      vegan/pescatarian candida diet for 1 month you will experience amazing
      results and your skin will be so much healthier than before. It was hard
      for me especially when Jake was having food I couldn't eat but it was so
      worth it in the long run. The good news is that after a few months now I
      have been able to re-introduce some foods that are not in the diet like
      bread/pizza and my skin won't flare up like it used to.</p><p>This is
      something that worked really well for me, it may not be the same for all
      of you but its worth a try. There is no downside to eating a really clean
      diet, only benefits. The hard part is having the willpower to stay strong
      when you're tempted to eat naughty food.</p><p>This solution might not be
      for you, in that case there are several other things that really helped
      me. I will list them below.&nbsp;</p>

      I canâ€™t stress enough how important it is to nourish your body with food
      that comes from the earth that isn't full of chemicals and processed sugar

      <h3>What other solutions helped me on my journey to getting off the pill
      and fixing my skin?</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>A good wholesome plant-based
      diet</h4><p>This won&rsquo;t come as a surprise. I can&rsquo;t stress
      enough how important it is to nourish your body with food that comes from
      the earth that isn't full of chemicals and processed sugar.</p><p>Even if
      you are not vegan or vegetarian, try to avoid processed food and refined
      sugars. This will make a huge difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Try to include in
      your diet more seeds, nuts, legumes and fresh veggies.</p><h4>No
      sugar</h4><p>Refined sugar is our number one enemy when it comes to
      health. Besides leading to heart diseases, increasing the risk of Type 2
      diabetes, accelerating aging, etc. it also causes skin breakouts and
      acne.&nbsp;</p><p>Avoiding sugar has been one of the most challenging
      parts of this journey. Every time I was craving it I had to remind myself
      about the reason I was doing all this. In the end, it is just not worth
      it.&nbsp;</p><h4>Drink a lot of water</h4><p>Staying hydrated is extremely
      important for our bodies. This is what gives us life.</p><p>If you
      don&rsquo;t drink enough water during the day, the skin is the first organ
      to suffer from it.&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure to drink at least 2 liters per
      day. And remember that when you feel thirsty you are already dehydrated
      and you are late. I carry a reusable bottle of water everywhere I go and I
      always keep it on the desk when I am working.</p><h4>Apple cider
      vinegar</h4><p>Apple cider vinegar was used as a natural remedy for health
      problems for a very long period of time. I incorporated it into my daily
      routine about a year ago. I mix it with water and drink it on an empty
      stomach every morning.&nbsp;</p><p>This has helped to not only clear out
      my skin but also improved my digestion and reduced bloating.</p><p>This is
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2yMhdZ4"><u>the one</u></a> I&rsquo;ve been
      using.&nbsp;</p><h4>Probiotics</h4><p>I can&rsquo;t stress enough how
      important your gut health is. If you have an imbalance in your gut, it
      prevents your body from absorbing and using the nutrients from your food,
      it also makes it difficult for your body to fight off viruses and
      infection. Probiotics will keep your&nbsp; gut healthy so you never need
      to worry about this. Probiotics will also reduce inflammation and help to
      get rid of the toxins which will have a beneficial effect on your
      skin.&nbsp;</p><p>You can either choose to buy them in capsules or you can
      include the following products in your diet: tempeh, kefir, yogurt,
      pickled veggies, miso, kimchi.</p><h4>Less stress</h4><p>It is no secret
      that stress is not good for us. Stress hormones affect all your hormones
      in general and this can cause breakouts.</p><p>Find the things that&nbsp;
      bring stress and anxiety into your life and see what changes you can make
      to minimize and eventually fully remove them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Sun and
      saltwater</h4><p>I feel like it can be very personal, as I&rsquo;ve heard
      people say that saltwater dries out their skin. However, I feel that it
      has had a positive impact on my skin. Have you ever taken a dip in the
      ocean and noticed how quickly any cuts and scratches heal after? The ocean
      is full of bacteria that can help us heal. It will have the same effect on
      your face skin, especially if you picked any of the
      pimples.&nbsp;</p><p>The sun helps our body to produce vitamin D and
      serotonin, which is associated with lifting up our mood, relaxation and
      stress decrease.</p><p>But remember that everything is good in
      moderation.&nbsp;</p><h4>Good sleep</h4><p>I feel like this goes together
      with having less stress in your life. Sleep is the time when your body and
      mind rest and recover. A healthy amount of sleep is considered 8 hours per
      night. I know it is not always possible but it is all about balance. If
      one night you sleep less than you catch up the next
      night.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a good night of sleep by itself won&rsquo;t cure
      your acne but in combination with other things from this list, it can do
      wonders.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-cms-popout-id="image-1"

      /></p><h4>No touching of the face</h4><p>Most of the time we are doing
      this without even noticing. But imagine all the bacteria you are
      transferring from your hands onto your already inflamed skin. This is not
      good for your skin, try to avoid it as much as possible.</p><h4>Use a
      clean towel</h4><p>The same goes for using a clean face towel. Try to
      change it at least every 3 days but preferably every day. I suggest buying
      a set of small towels that will be used for face only, not even for your
      hands.&nbsp;</p><h4><a href="https://amzn.to/2WOBkxL"><u>Tea tree
      oil</u></a></h4><p>This oil has a great anti-inflammatory effect. When I
      feel that I am about to get a pimple, I apply tea tree oil on that spot
      and it reduces the redness and sometimes the pimple won&rsquo;t even come
      out. I also find that it helps to prevent and reduce scarring and leave my
      skin smooth and soft.&nbsp;</p><h4><a
      href="https://amzn.to/3fHFEI0"><u>Pure aloe vera</u></a></h4><p>This is
      another great natural solution for scaring. I like applying it overnight.
      I only do it on the area where I have breakouts and I find that in the
      morning my skin looks much less inflamed.</p><p><img
      data-cms-popout-id="image-0"
      data-cms-original-src="/images/style/aloe-vera-maja.jpg" width="1600"

      /></p><h4>Celery juice</h4><p>Celery juice has a huge detoxifying and
      strengthening effect on our bodies. And naturally having less toxins in
      your body will have a positive effect on your skin. Celery juice is also
      high in sodium which raises stomach acids and it helps us to digest and to
      break down food fast. As a result, this leads to a healthy gut which we
      all know now has direct connection to the quality of our
      skin.&nbsp;</p><h4><a href="https://amzn.to/3cq7RRp"><u>Hemp seed
      oil</u></a></h4><p>Why hemp seed oil? Because it helps to moisturize our
      skin without clogging it and it is suitable for most skin types. Dryness
      can cause your skin to overproduce oil and this leads to more
      breakouts.</p>

      quick fix and the professionals in the field tend to say the same. Apart
      from the above things I've mentioned what else do the professionals
      say?</p><p><strong>Get your mineral levels tested:</strong> zinc, selenim,
      Vitamin D3, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Omega 3, Q10. In case you have
      deficiency consider supplementing certain essential minerals and
      vitamins.</p><p><strong>Take care of your liver -&nbsp;</strong>It is
      responsible for getting toxins out of our bodies. I&rsquo;ve already
      mentioned this a few times in the post, but only because it is this
      important. Fewer toxins = better skin.</p><p>Try to include in your diet
      more foods that have bitter substances in them (such as artichokes, sage
      and Brussel sprouts)</p><p>Also try to keep alcohol to a
      minimum.</p><p><strong>Good skincare</strong> - start paying more
      attention to the ingredients list of your skincare. General rule - if you
      can&rsquo;t pronounce it, it&rsquo;s not good for you. Try to avoid
      silicon, parabens, and alcohol as much as possible. Search for more
      natural ingredients, such as mentioned before - aloe vera, good oils
      (coconut, hemp, tea tree, argan, essential oils, etc), avocado, apple
      cider vinegar, etc.&nbsp;</p>

### Midway through 2018 I finally decided to get off the pill once and for all

From the moment I made that decision I have been fighting a constant battle to rebalance my hormones and regain the healthy skin I once had. It has been a tiring process and I almost gave in several times to the allure of clean skin by manipulating my hormones with the â€˜pillâ€™. In this blog post I'm not going to talk about why the pill is bad for you or why I decided to quit. At this point I just want to share with you how I succeeded at rebalancing my hormones and how I brought my skin back under control.

This is for all you girls out there who want to get off the pill but you have struggled with skin issues every time you try. I want you to believe there is a way for you to regain your healthy skin and say goodbye to the horrible pill for good. I can tell you now with patience and commitment you can do it. And I am confident that with the right information and learning from my mistakes you can do it much quicker.&nbsp;

It for sure hasnâ€™t been easy and I've tried almost every treatment you can think of. From different diets, medications and home remedies to staying out of the sun or covering my face in apple cider vinegar. I tried it all and I finally found a remedy for me. Now I know what I need to do to control my skin, but that doesn't mean my skin is always perfect. It just means that I know why my skin goes bad when it does, and I know how to fix it.

If you struggle with any sort of skin issue you really need to ask yourself WHY\!\! What does my skin want to tell me here? The skin is our biggest organ and holds 20% of our natural bacteria in it and on it, this bacteria gets fed by the other 80% of our bacteria in our gut. The skin is the window to our inner health and is also an organ that releases a lot of our toxins. So if there is something wrong with your skin, ask yourself - what could be the tigger??

Do I have too much physical or mental stress right now, how good is my sleep, am I drinking enough, do I drink alcohol or smoke, what do I eat?? These are the questions we need to ask ourselves. I know life sometimes isn't fair and there are girls out there who have great skin while eating whatever they want. But that does not mean they are healthy. They might even be still taking the birth control pill which helps with your skin but causes a lot of harm to your body.

**How I healed my skin after coming off the pill**

The first thing I would suggest if youâ€™re wanting to come off the pill or if youâ€™re already trying, is to go and get a complete blood test. The results will let you know if you are deficient in any nutrients or if you have other conditions that need to be taken care of that might affect or be affecting your skin.

After a couple months of being off the pill I also recommend you get a hormone test to gauge how your hormones are balancing out.

Now if youâ€™re anything like me I know youâ€™re serious about taking back control of your hormones and just overall becoming more in tune with your true self. So I'm going to jump right into the most effective solution that I found to heal my skin and rebalance my internal system. It is not an easy solution and it takes willpower to stick to it but it will change everything if you can.&nbsp;

#### The vegan/pescatarian candida diet&nbsp;

I got on this diet to try and heal my all my fungus diseases (my **[candida](https://www.nutriplanet.org/2018/08/candida-overgrowth-guide/),&nbsp;**the**&nbsp;**acne on my face & white spots on my back called **[tinea versicolour](https://www.healthline.com/health/tinea-versicolor)**). The white spots Ive lived with for almost 15 years. This diet healed all my skin conditions when I was 100% strict with it. No more acne or pimples anywhere. However when I do not take 100% care of myself (bad diet, stress, sweaty clothes, bad sleep) my skin tells me right away. I have it much better under control but it is fair to say: In order to have amazing skin you have to work on yourself. It is an ongoing process.

Overtime from taking too many anti-inflammatories, drinking alcohol and eating processed/sugary and fried foods, I developed an unhealthy gut environment. An unhealthy gut is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria and fungus that can have a really damaging effect on your skin. Before you can take back control of your skin you need to create a healthy gut environment and I believe the best and most effective way to do this is to go on a strict vegan/pescatarian candida diet. I am going to link a great article about what this diet includes and some recipes for you [**<u>here</u>**](https://www.thecandidadiet.com/candida-diet-vegan-vegetarian/)\!

Essentially a **[vegan/pescatarian candida diet](https://www.nutriplanet.org)** is a diet that restricts all processed food and all refined sugars/carbs. I was shocked that I wasn't allowed to eat fruit, even the sugar in fruit was feeding the bad bacteria in my gut. I was also shocked that after 2 years of being vegan and eating predominantly whole foods, my gut wasn't healthy already. The problem is sugar\! Once you have bad bacteria in your gut it can survive for years even on a really healthy diet. All the bad bacteria needs is some white bread or a bit of pasta or pizza or some coconut ice cream and it will stay with you.

I wish I could say that you can have a cheat meal here and there, or eating a sugary dessert once a week is ok. But what I found was that as soon as I made one mistake and ate something I shouldn't have, my skin would flair up right away and I would need to start again from the beginning.&nbsp;

This is something that worked really well for me, it may not be the same for all of you but its worth a try. There is no downside to eating a really clean diet, only benefits. The hard part is having the willpower to stay strong when you're tempted to eat naughty food.

This solution might not be for you, in that case there are several other things that really helped me. I will list them below.&nbsp;

### What other solutions helped me on my journey to getting off the pill and fixing my skin?

&nbsp;

#### A good wholesome plant-based diet

This wonâ€™t come as a surprise. I canâ€™t stress enough how important it is to nourish your body with food that comes from the earth that isn't full of chemicals and processed sugar.

Even if you are not vegan, try to avoid processed food, and refined sugars. This will make a huge difference.&nbsp;

Try to include in your diet more seeds, nuts, legumes and fresh veggies.

#### No sugar

Refined sugar is our number one enemy when it comes to health. Besides leading to heart diseases, increasing the risk of Type 2 diabetes, accelerating aging, etc. it also causes skin breakouts and acne.&nbsp;

Avoiding sugar has been one of the most challenging parts of this journey. Every time I was craving it I had to remind myself about the reason I was doing all this. In the end, it is just not worth it.&nbsp;

#### Drink a lot of water

Staying hydrated is extremely important for our bodies. This is what gives us life.

If you donâ€™t drink enough water during the day, the skin is the first organ to suffer from it.&nbsp;

Make sure to drink at least 2 liters per day. And remember that when you feel thirsty you are already dehydrated and you are late. I carry a reusable bottle of water everywhere I go and I always keep it on the desk when I am working.

#### Apple cider vinegar

Apple cider vinegar was used as a natural remedy for health problems for a very long period of time. I incorporated it into my daily routine about a year ago. I mix it with water and drink it on an empty stomach every morning.&nbsp;

This has helped to not only clear out my skin but also improved my digestion and reduced bloating.

This is [<u>the one</u>](https://amzn.to/2yMhdZ4) Iâ€™ve been using.&nbsp;

#### Probiotics

I canâ€™t stress enough how important your gut health is. If you have an imbalance in your gut, it prevents your body from absorbing and using the nutrients from your food, it also makes it difficult for your body to fight off viruses and infection. Probiotics will keep your&nbsp; gut healthy so you never need to worry about this. Probiotics will also reduce inflammation and help to get rid of the toxins which will have a beneficial effect on your skin.&nbsp;

You can either choose to buy them in capsules or you can include the following products in your diet: tempeh, kefir, yogurt, pickled veggies, miso, kimchi.

#### Less stress

It is no secret that stress is not good for us. Stress hormones affect all your hormones in general and this can cause breakouts.

Find the things that&nbsp; bring stress and anxiety into your life and see what changes you can make to minimize and eventually fully remove them.

&nbsp;

#### Sun and saltwater

I feel like it can be very personal, as Iâ€™ve heard people say that saltwater dries out their skin. However, I feel that it has had a positive impact on my skin. Have you ever taken a dip in the ocean and noticed how quickly any cuts and scratches heal after? The ocean is full of bacteria that can help us heal. It will have the same effect on your face skin, especially if you picked any of the pimples.&nbsp;

The sun helps our body to produce vitamin D and serotonin, which is associated with lifting up our mood, relaxation and stress decrease. But remember that everything is good in moderation.&nbsp;

#### Good sleep

I feel like this goes together with having less stress in your life. Sleep is the time when your body and mind rest and recover. A healthy amount of sleep is considered 8 hours per night. I know it is not always possible but it is all about balance. If one night you sleep less than you catch up the next night.&nbsp;

Having a good night of sleep by itself wonâ€™t cure your acne but in combination with other things from this list, it can do wonders.&nbsp;

#### No touching of the face

Most of the time we are doing this without even noticing. But imagine all the bacteria you are transferring from your hands onto your already inflamed skin. This is not good for your skin, try to avoid it as much as possible.

#### Use a clean towel

The same goes for using a clean face towel. Try to change it at least every 3 days but preferably every day. I suggest buying a set of small towels that will be used for face only, not even for your hands.&nbsp;

#### [<u>Tea tree oil</u>](https://amzn.to/2WOBkxL)

This oil has a great anti-inflammatory effect. When I feel that I am about to get a pimple, <u>I apply pure tea tree oil (mix: one drop with a carrier oil 10 drops)</u>&nbsp;on that spot and it reduces the redness and sometimes the pimple wonâ€™t even come out. I also find that it helps to prevent and reduce scarring and leave my skin smooth and soft.&nbsp;

#### [<u>Pure aloe vera</u>](https://amzn.to/3fHFEI0)

This is another great natural solution for scaring. I like applying it overnight. I only do it on the area where I have breakouts and I find that in the morning my skin looks much less inflamed.

#### Celery juice

Celery juice has a huge detoxifying and strengthening effect on our bodies. And naturally having less toxins in your body will have a positive effect on your skin. Celery juice is also high in sodium which raises stomach acids and it helps us to digest and to break down food fast. As a result, this leads to a healthy gut which we all know now has direct connection to the quality of our skin.&nbsp;

### What is advised by professionals:

If you've tried coming off the pill and had struggles with your skin/rebalancing your hormones, you will know how difficult it is to find the answers you're looking for. Its especially hard because you want results to come NOW\! I've found that there is no quick fix and the professionals in the field tend to say the same. Apart from the above things I've mentioned what else do the professionals say?

**Get your mineral levels tested:** zinc, selenim, Vitamin D3, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Omega 3, Q10. In case you have deficiency consider supplementing certain essential minerals and vitamins.

**Take care of your liver -&nbsp;**It is responsible for getting toxins out of our bodies. Iâ€™ve already mentioned this a few times in the post, but only because it is this important. Fewer toxins = better skin.

Try to include in your diet more foods that have bitter substances in them (such as artichokes, sage and Brussel sprouts)

Also try to keep alcohol to a minimum.

**Good skincare** - start paying more attention to the ingredients list of your skincare. General rule - if you canâ€™t pronounce it, itâ€™s not good for you. Try to avoid silicon, parabens, and alcohol as much as possible. Search for more natural ingredients, such as mentioned before - aloe vera, good oils (coconut, hemp, tea tree, argan, essential oils, etc), avocado, apple cider vinegar, etc.&nbsp;

#### You can do it

The hardest for me was being consistent. Every time my skin broke out I felt really bad which made me want to eat bad food, which would then make my skin even worse.&nbsp;

If you really want to get rid of the pill for good you need to be consistent and patient. You need to be kind to yourself and accept that you will have some bad days. It is CRAZY how many girls have had to go through this or are currently going through it. We really are all in this together\!\!&nbsp;

Being free of the pill and feeling like myself again is wonderful, although the journey was difficult and I had many struggles. Being on the other side now is absolutely worth it all.

I </u>hope you all learnt a lot from this blog post and it has given you some hope. I will write another blog post soon talking about why I got off the pill, what contraceptives I recommend and why you should think about what the pill is doing to you.&nbsp;
