intro-paragraph-emphasis: Midway through 2018 I finally decided to get off the pill once and for all
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>&nbsp;From the moment I made that decision I have been fighting a constant
  battle to rebalance my hormones and regain the healthy skin I once had. It has
  been a tiring process and I almost gave in several times to the allure of
  clean skin by manipulating my hormones with the &lsquo;pill&rsquo;. In this
  blog post i'm not going to talk about why the pill is bad for you or why I
  decided to quit. At this point I just want to share with you how I succeeded
  at rebalancing my hormones and how I brought my skin back under
  control.</p><p>This is for all you girls out there who want to get off the
  pill but you have struggled with skin issues every time you try. I want you to
  believe there is a way for you to regain your healthy skin and say goodbye to
  the horrible pill for good. I am living proof that with patience and
  commitment you can do it. I am proud to say that I didn't give in. After
  almost 2 years I can confidently announce that I've won the battle and
  regained control over my skin and you can too! I am confident that with the
  right information and learning from my mistakes you can do it much
  quicker.&nbsp;</p><p>It for sure hasn&rsquo;t been easy and I've tried almost
  every treatment you can think of. From different diets, medications and home
  remedies to staying out of the sun or covering my face in apple cider vinegar.
  I tried it all and I finally found out the perfect remedy for me. Now I know
  what I need to do to control my skin, but that doesn't mean my skin is always
  perfect. It just means that I know why my skin goes bad when it does, and I
  know how to fix it.</p>

      An unhealthy gut is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria and fungus
      that can have a really damaging effect on your skin.
    body-content_html: >-
      <h4><strong>How I healed my skin after coming off the
      pill</strong></h4><p>The first thing I would suggest you do if
      you&rsquo;re wanting to come off the pill or if you&rsquo;re already
      trying, is to go and get a complete blood test. The results will let you
      know if you are deficient in any nutrients or if you have other conditions
      that need to be taken care of that might affect or be affecting your
      progress. After a couple months of being off the pill I also recommend you
      get a hormone test to gauge how your hormones are balancing
      out.&nbsp;</p><p>Now if you&rsquo;re anything like me I know you&rsquo;re
      serious about taking back control of your hormones and just overall
      becoming more in tune with your true self. So I'm going to jump right into
      the most effective solution that I found to heal my skin and rebalance my
      internal system. It is not an easy solution and it takes willpower to
      stick to it but it will change everything if you can.&nbsp;</p><h4>The
      vegan candida diet&nbsp;</h4><p>I got on this diet to try and heal my
      candida fungus (white spots on my back) that I have had for 15 years. It
      not only healed my candida, it healed all my skin conditions. No more acne
      or pimples anywhere. From this I learnt that the health of my skin has a
      direct correlation to the health of my gut environment. Overtime from
      taking too many anti-inflammatories, drinking alcohol and eating
      processed/sugary and fried foods, I developed an unhealthy gut
      environment. An unhealthy gut is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria
      and fungus that can have a really damaging effect on your skin. Before you
      can take back control of your skin you need to create a healthy gut
      environment and I believe the best and most effective way to do this is to
      go on a strict vegan/vegetarian candida diet. I am going to link a great
      article about what this diet includes and some recipes for you <a
      href="https://www.thecandidadiet.com/candida-diet-vegan-vegetarian/"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a>!</p><p><img

      data-cms-popout-id="image-0"
      data-cms-original-src="/images/food/vegan-food8.jpg" width="4464"
      height="2976" /></p><p>Essentially a vegan/vegetarian candida diet is a
      diet that restricts all processed food and all refined sugars/carbs. I was
      shocked that I wasn't allowed to eat fruit, even the sugar in fruit was
      feeding the bad bacteria in my gut. I was also shocked that after 2 years
      of being vegan and eating predominantly whole foods, my gut isn't healthy
      already. The problem is sugar and once you have bad bacteria in your gut
      it can survive for years even on a really healthy diet. All the bad
      bacteria needs is some white bread or a bit of pasta or pizza or some
      coconut ice cream and it will stay with you.</p><p>I wish I could say that
      you can have a cheat meal here and there, or eating a sugary dessert once
      a week is ok. But what I found was that as soon as I made one mistake and
      ate something I shouldn't have, my skin would flair up right away and I
      would need to start again from the beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>I am so
      confident that if you can stick to a full vegan/vegetarian candida diet
      for 1 month you will experience amazing results and your skin will be so
      much healthier than before. It was hard for me especially when Jake was
      having food I couldn't eat but it was so worth it in the long run. The
      good news is that after a few months now I have been able to re-introduce
      some foods that are not in the diet like bread/pizza and my skin won't
      flare up like it used to.</p>

      I canâ€™t stress enough how important it is to nourish your body with food
      that comes from the earth that isn't full of chemicals and processed sugar
    body-content_html: >-
      <h3>What other solutions helped me on my journey to getting off the
      pill?</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>A good wholesome plant-based diet</h4><p>This
      won&rsquo;t come as a surprise. I can&rsquo;t stress enough how important
      it is to nourish your body with food that comes from the earth that isn't
      full of chemicals and processed sugar.</p><p>Even if you are not vegan or
      vegetarian, try to avoid processed food and refined sugars. This will make
      a huge difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Try to include in your diet more seeds,
      nuts, legumes and fresh veggies.</p><h4>No sugar</h4><p>Refined sugar is
      our number one enemy when it comes to health. Besides leading to heart
      diseases, increasing the risk of Type 2 diabetes, accelerating aging, etc.
      it also causes skin breakouts and acne.&nbsp;</p><p>Avoiding sugar has
      been one of the most challenging parts of this journey. Every time I was
      craving it I had to remind myself about the reason I was doing all this.
      In the end, it is just not worth it.&nbsp;</p><h4>Drink a lot of
      water</h4><p>Staying hydrated is extremely important for our bodies. This
      is what gives us life.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t drink enough water during
      the day, the skin is the first organ to suffer from it.&nbsp;</p><p>Make
      sure to drink at least 2 liters per day. And remember that when you feel
      thirsty you are already dehydrated and you are late. I carry a reusable
      bottle of water everywhere I go and I always keep it on the desk when I am
      working.</p><h4>Apple cider vinegar</h4><p>Apple cider vinegar was used as
      a natural remedy for health problems for a very long period of time. I
      incorporated it into my daily routine about a year ago. I mix it with
      water and drink it on an empty stomach every morning.&nbsp;</p><p>This has
      helped to not only clear out my skin but also improved my digestion and
      reduced bloating.</p><p>This is <a href="https://amzn.to/2yMhdZ4"><u>the
      one</u></a> I&rsquo;ve been using.&nbsp;</p><h4>Probiotics</h4><p>I
      can&rsquo;t stress enough how important your gut health is. If you have an
      imbalance in your gut, it prevents your body from absorbing and using the
      nutrients from your food, it also makes it difficult for your body to
      fight off viruses and infection. Probiotics will keep your&nbsp; gut
      healthy so you never need to worry about this. Probiotics will also reduce
      inflammation and help to get rid of the toxins which will have a
      beneficial effect on your skin.&nbsp;</p><p>You can either choose to buy
      them in capsules or you can include the following products in your diet:
      tempeh, kefir, yogurt, pickled veggies, miso, kimchi.</p><h4>Less
      stress</h4><p>It is no secret that stress is not good for us. Stress
      hormones affect all your hormones in general and this can cause
      breakouts.</p><p>Find the things that&nbsp; bring stress and anxiety into
      your life and see what changes you can make to minimize and eventually
      fully remove them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Sun and saltwater</h4><p>I feel
      like it can be very personal, as I&rsquo;ve heard people say that
      saltwater dries out their skin. However, I feel that it has had a positive
      impact on my skin. Have you ever taken a dip in the ocean and noticed how
      quickly any cuts and scratches heal after? The ocean is full of bacteria
      that can help us heal. It will have the same effect on your face skin,
      especially if you picked any of the pimples.&nbsp;</p><p>The sun helps our
      body to produce vitamin D and serotonin, which is associated with lifting
      up our mood, relaxation and stress decrease.</p><p>But remember that
      everything is good in moderation.&nbsp;</p><h4>Good sleep</h4><p>I feel
      like this goes together with having less stress in your life. Sleep is the
      time when your body and mind rest and recover. A healthy amount of sleep
      is considered 8 hours per night. I know it is not always possible but it
      is all about balance. If one night you sleep less than you catch up the
      next night.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a good night of sleep by itself won&rsquo;t
      cure your acne but in combination with other things from this list, it can
      do wonders.&nbsp;</p><h4>No touching of the face</h4><p>Most of the time
      we are doing this without even noticing. But imagine all the bacteria you
      are transferring from your hands onto your already inflamed skin. This is
      not good for your skin, try to avoid it as much as possible.</p><h4>Use a
      clean towel</h4><p>The same goes for using a clean face towel. Try to
      change it at least every 3 days but preferably every day. I suggest buying
      a set of small towels that will be used for face only, not even for your
      hands.&nbsp;</p><h4><a href="https://amzn.to/2WOBkxL"><u>Tea tree
      oil</u></a></h4><p>This oil has a great anti-inflammatory effect. When I
      feel that I am about to get a pimple, I apply tea tree oil on that spot
      and it reduces the redness and sometimes the pimple won&rsquo;t even come
      out. I also find that it helps to prevent and reduce scarring and leave my
      skin smooth and soft.&nbsp;</p><h4><a
      href="https://amzn.to/3fHFEI0"><u>Pure aloe vera</u></a></h4><p>This is
      another great natural solution for scaring. I like applying it overnight.
      I only do it on the area where I have breakouts and I find that in the
      morning my skin looks much less inflamed.</p><h4>Celery
      juice</h4><p>Celery juice has a huge detoxifying and strengthening effect
      on our bodies. And naturally having less toxins in your body will have a
      positive effect on your skin. Celery juice is also high in sodium which
      raises stomach acids and it helps us to digest and to break down food
      fast. As a result, this leads to a healthy gut which we all know now has
      direct connection to the quality of our skin.&nbsp;</p><h4><a
      href="https://amzn.to/3cq7RRp"><u>Hemp seed oil</u></a></h4><p>Why hemp
      seed oil? Because it helps to moisturize our skin without clogging it and
      it is suitable for most skin types. Dryness can cause your skin to
      overproduce oil and this leads to more breakouts.</p>
