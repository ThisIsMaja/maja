intro-paragraph-emphasis: Midway through 2018 I finally decided to get off the pill once and for all
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>&nbsp;From the moment I made that decision I have been fighting a constant
  battle to rebalance my hormones and regain the healthy skin I once had. It has
  been a tiring process and I almost gave in several times to the allure of
  clean skin by manipulating my hormones with the &lsquo;pill&rsquo;. In this
  blog post i'm not going to talk about why the pill is bad for you or why I
  decided to quit. At this point I just want to share with you how I succeeded
  at rebalancing my hormones and how I brought my skin back under
  control.</p><p>This is for all you girls out there who want to get off the
  pill but you have struggled with skin issues every time you try. I want you to
  believe there is a way for you to regain your healthy skin and say goodbye to
  the horrible pill for good. I am living proof that with patience and
  commitment you can do it. I am proud to say that I didn't give in. After
  almost 2 years I can confidently announce that I've won the battle and
  regained control over my skin and you can too! I am confident that with the
  right information and learning from my mistakes you can do it much
  quicker.&nbsp;</p><p>It for sure hasn&rsquo;t been easy and I've tried almost
  every treatment you can think of. From different diets, medications and home
  remedies to staying out of the sun or covering my face in apple cider vinegar.
  I tried it all and I finally found out the perfect remedy for me. Now I know
  what I need to do to control my skin, but that doesn't mean my skin is always
  perfect. It just means that I know why my skin goes bad when it does, and I
  know how to fix it.</p>

    main-paragraph-emphasis: We all have to start somewhere
    body-content_html: >-
      <p>For the past 3 years, we have been posting 20 to 30 instagram stories
      every single day. If you're thinking &lsquo;well you guys must be
      naturals&rsquo; then think again. In the beginning it felt so wrong!! We
      felt awkward and we weren't confident that people would actually get value
      or care about what we were saying. However, we stuck with it because we
      thought if at least one person would smile or be inspired by what we were
      doing, then that would be enough. It didn't take long before we had proof
      that at least one person liked what we were doing. We started receiving
      messages from people telling us that our courage and stories were
      inspirational. That was all the motivation we needed to continue creating
      and sharing everyday.&nbsp;</p><p>You are special and you have something
      to offer the world! If you feel like you want to share your voice, your
      talents, your vision with the world then you MUST. There will always be
      people that will try to bring you down or laugh at you but those people
      have their own issues. Don't let them control how you feel about yourself
      and certainly don't let them stop you from creating a life you are proud
      of.</p><p>Now that you know you can do it and that we were once in exactly
      the same position as you with the same fears and same worries -
      let&rsquo;s talk about how you can start creating Instagram stories that
      will catch peoples attention and give them
      value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
