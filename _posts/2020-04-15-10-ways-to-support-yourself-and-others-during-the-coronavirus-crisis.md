  <p>The coronavirus will have an effect on you one way or another.
  Unfortunately, the virus and its aftereffects have washed across the globe,
  affecting businesses, travel and leisure activities. There have been cases of
  infections in almost every country, resulting in lockdowns, restricted
  movement and widespread panic. Even if you are pretty sure you won&rsquo;t get
  the virus, just knowing about it and seeing updated statistics on almost all
  social channels can have you feeling exhausted, overwhelmed and
  unproductive.</p><p>Now, more than ever, we should take extra care not only
  with our physical health but also our mental health. Our moods and behaviours
  can indirectly affect those around us and when we decide to approach this
  coronavirus storm with calm, positivity and a clear mind, we can create a
  positive space filled with good vibrations for ourselves and others.</p>

    main-paragraph-emphasis: Take a social media timeout to avoid cluttering your mind
    body-content_html: >-
      <ol><li><strong>Follow the rules of the country you are currently
      in</strong> for your own safety and those around you.</li><li><strong>Take
      a step back and turn your situation positive.</strong> Allowing negative
      emotions to fester because you are feeling upset or pressured can affect
      your mental health and productivity. Creating positive affirmations like
      &lsquo;I will get through this&rsquo; can make a big
      difference.</li><li><strong>Stick with your normal routine the best you
      can.</strong> Example: don&rsquo;t go into a panic because you cannot go
      to the gym anymore. Find a home exercise alternative and stick to your
      routine, this will help you to stay calm and
      productive.</li><li><strong>Reach out to loved ones.</strong> Now is a
      good time to say those things you need to say. You never know, the other
      person might just be needing your support more than you
      realise.</li><li><strong>Take a social media timeout </strong>to avoid
      cluttering your mind with inflated panic. Choose one valid resource to get
      your coronavirus information from and only allow yourself to check it once
      a day. If you feel the itch to check your socials more, look at a funny
      cat video instead.</li><li><strong>Make a &lsquo;worry-list&rsquo;
      </strong>about what is freaking you out because of the virus. Writing it
      down and meditating over it will most likely have you realise you are
      overreacting and give you possible solutions to your
      worries.</li><li><strong>Create new healthy habits.</strong> Do more yoga
      self-practice, eat more vitamin-loaded fruits and vegetables, sleep more.
      These are good habits to improve not only your immune system but your
      overall health.</li><li><strong>Practice meditation and
      mindfulness</strong> with positive affirmations to keep yourself calm and
      productive during a crisis.</li><li><strong>Be grateful</strong> for what
      you have and realise that it is probably
      enough.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t be selfish </strong>and panic buy.
      Leave some for everyone.</li></ol><p>It is important to stay true to
      yourself during this time and not get lost in the sea of over-information
      and crisis. If you can anchor yourself, stay calm and positive, you can
      become a support anchor for those in your immediate community. Positivity,
      just like panic, can be contagious, and once it takes flight it&rsquo;s
      hard to stop.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
