  <p>Recently I wrote a blog post about <a
  href="https://thisismaja.com/posts/healing-skin-after-coming-off-the-pill">how
  I healed my skin after coming off the pill</a>. The process of coming off the
  pill was so challenging and so stressful, you are probably wondering why I put
  myself through that? There are many reasons why and I want to share those
  reasons with you in this blog post. I also want to tell you about what
  alternatives there are and what is working for me.</p><p>So how did I end up
  going down the path of first questioning the pill and then decided to get off
  it completely. 4 years ago I started a journey towards a more holistic,
  conscious and healthy lifestyle. I started focusing on eating whole
  plant-based food, exercising, meditating and in general reconnecting with my
  natural self. This sort of 'awakening' has honestly changed my life in so many
  ways. Im happier, I'm more successful, I feel so much healthier, Im filled
  with love most days.</p><p>About 18 months ago I found myself in a conundrum
  that a lot of girls also find themselves in. While everyday I was doing all
  the right things like eating healthy, exercising and practising mindfulness I
  was also taking a synthetic pill that went against everything I was trying to
  achieve.</p><p>How could I continue living such a natural lifestyle while
  taking a pill that is full of synthetic hormones and is everything but
  natural? And whats more, I asked myself 'how unfair and evil is it that we
  females are told to get on the pill at a young age. And then when we want to
  get off because we are wise enough to make informed decisions, we cant because
  the effects of coming off are so bad that most of us would prefer to just put
  up with it'. I was committed to breaking free of this cycle and I really want
  to help you if you're ready for it.</p>

      <h4><strong>Why the pill is not natural</strong></h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your
      body has its own sets of cycles, circadian rhythms and internal body
      clocks that produces hormones when we need them, and keeps our basic
      homeostatic processes running smoothly. A woman&rsquo;s menstrual cycle
      regulates fertility and has an impact on her mood, bone health, skin
      health and even mental clarity. The intricate balance between shifting
      oestrogen and progesterone levels is what drives this. The pill
      manipulates our natural cycle by pushing these hormones into an unnatural
      flat curve, effectively stopping ovulation from occurring, and then
      inducing a &lsquo;fake period&rsquo; by letting hormone levels drop
      suddenly (placebo pills).</p><p>For some women who struggle with terribly
      painful or heavy periods, unbalanced hormones, or conditions like
      polycystic ovarian syndrome, the pill can be a lifesaver. But for all of
      us out there who don't have any issues, the pill actually does more harm
      than good. Our bodies have evolved over thousands of years constantly
      changing and adapting to our environment. We are perfect just the way we
      are and when we try to interfere with something so complex like the human
      body made up of trillions on cells all communicating and working together,
      things are bound to go wrong.&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><strong>Common 'side' effects of the pill and

      effects'. It means that certain negative effects from a drug or the pill
      for example are unintended. But those effects are not 'side' effects, they
      are just 'effects'. The drugs directly cause those things and there is no
      other way to put it. When it comes to the pill these 'effects' are
      especially bad, one of them being when you get on you can't get back off
      without withdrawals and skin flare ups.</p><p>Some of the most common side
      effects women on combined oral contraceptives complain
      about:</p><ul><li>Affects mood and behaviour</li><li>Increases depression

      and increased appetite</li><li>Oestrogen-induced
      migraines</li><li>Irregular bleeding</li><li>Breast
      tenderness</li></ul><p>The pill can also increase the risk of developing
      breast cancer later in life and the development of blood clots and
      stroke.&nbsp;</p><p>Most manufacturers advise that women older than 35,
      smokers, and women with a history or family history of high blood
      pressure, stroke, blood clots, breast or uterine cancer, migraine with
      aura or diabetes should not use the pill because of an increased risk of
      side effects. Also, the pill does not protect against sexually transmitted
      diseases.</p>

      that the benefits of taking the pill did not outweigh the risk, my body is

      on our shoulders. Think about your priorities and try to align your

      your top priority might be to have fun and not worry about the

**Why the pill may be bad for you**

Recently I wrote a blog post about [how](__notset__)[I healed my skin after coming off the pill](https://thisismaja.com/posts/healing-skin-after-coming-off-the-pill).

About 18 months ago I found myself in a conundrum that a lot of girls also find themselves in. While everyday I was doing all the right things like eating healthy, exercising and practising mindfulness I was also taking a synthetic pill that went against everything I was trying to achieve.

***Why the pill is not natural***

Your body has its own sets of cycles, circadian rhythms and internal body clocks that produces hormones when we need them, and keeps our basic homeostatic processes running smoothly. A woman’s menstrual cycle regulates fertility and has an impact on her mood, bone health, skin health and even mental clarity. The intricate balance between shifting oestrogen and progesterone levels is what drives this. The pill manipulates our natural cycle by pushing these hormones into an unnatural flat curve, effectively stopping ovulation from occurring, and then inducing a ‘fake period’ by letting hormone levels drop suddenly (placebo pills).

For some women who struggle with terribly painful or heavy periods, unbalanced hormones, or conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome, the pill can be a lifesaver. But for all of us out there who don't have any issues, the pill actually does more harm than good. Our bodies have evolved over thousands of years constantly changing and adapting to our environment. We are perfect just the way we are and when we try to interfere with something so complex like the human body made up of trillions on cells all communicating and working together, things are bound to go wrong.&nbsp;

***Common 'side' effects of the pill and warnings***

I really don't like the term 'side effects'. It means that certain negative effects from a drug or the pill for example are unintended. But those effects are not 'side' effects, they are just 'effects'. The drugs cause those things and there is no other way to put it. When it comes to the pill these 'effects' are especially bad, one of them being when you get on you can't get back off without withdrawals and skin flare ups.

Some of the most common side effects women on combined oral contraceptives complain about:

* Affects mood and behaviour
* Increases depression and anxiety
* Causes a change in libido
* Causes weight gain and increased appetite
* Oestrogen-induced migraines
* Irregular bleeding
* Breast tenderness

The pill can also increase the risk of developing breast cancer later in life and the development of blood clots and stroke.&nbsp;

Most manufacturers advise that women older than 35, smokers, and women with a history or family history of high blood pressure, stroke, blood clots, breast or uterine cancer, migraine with aura or diabetes should not use the pill because of an increased risk of side effects. Also, the pill does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases.

***Natural contraception choices to consider***

Contraception is extremely important when we want to avoid unplanned pregnancy, and the pill has a 99% success rate. But there has always been some controversy surrounding the pill and it’s a perfect case of the benefits outweighing the risks. I decided that the benefits of taking the pill did not outweigh the risk, my body is my temple. There is a great quote that reads 'every time you put something in your body it either ***feeds&nbsp;***or&nbsp;***fights&nbsp;***disease. I want you to think about what category the pill would fall into if you had to take a guess.

Here is a full list of potential natural solutions for you, remember that no contraceptive method is 100% effective and if you want to avoid being pregnant entirely the only option is to abstain completely from intercourse.&nbsp;
