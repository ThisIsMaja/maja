  Over the last few weeks we have been getting many questions on travel - when
  we will travel, what it will look like, and how the industry will manage
  during this pandemic.
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>This is the longest period in four years that we haven&rsquo;t travelled,
  so it has been a major change for us!&nbsp; We know many of you share our
  passion for travel so it&rsquo;s something on all our minds.&nbsp;</p><p>We
  don&rsquo;t have all the answers right now, we are letting the health experts
  lead the way. But, one thing we do know is that the coronavirus restrictions
  will be a reality for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While countries around the
  world have been locked down for months now, we are slowly starting to see
  things open up around the world, but leisure travel has still pretty much
  screeched to a halt for now.&nbsp; Countries are handling the pandemic
  differently so it&rsquo;s important to follow guidance issued by your own
  government agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>We wanted to take the time to answer some of
  your burning questions related to travel the best we can!&nbsp;</p>

      <h3><em>When will we travel again</em></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We don&rsquo;t
      know when we will travel, as we will only travel when it is safe and
      responsible to do so.&nbsp; We have postponed our travel plans
      indefinitely, and will follow the guidelines to learn when is a good time
      to rebook. We have been staying close to the updates to learn more about
      how travel will change due to the coronavirus. We want to ensure we are
      informed, and make well balanced decisions when the time
      comes!&nbsp;</p><p>The first thing we will do when the borders open up is
      visit our families in Australia and Germany.&nbsp;</p>

      We think travel will look significantly different when it comes time to
      hop on a flight again.
    body-content_html: >-
      <h3><strong>How will we travel again</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We know
      airlines and hotels around the world have been working to implement new
      policies and measures to protect guests and limit the spread of the virus.
      We think travel will look significantly different when it comes time to
      hop on a flight again.</p><p><strong><em>Airlines</em></strong></p><p>Many
      airlines have already made significant changes to the onboard
      experience.&nbsp; They are implementing things like:</p><ul><li>Mandatory
      Personal Protective Equipment: In some countries, and on certain airlines,
      masks/face coverings are now mandatory onboard for both passengers and
      crew.&nbsp; Cabin crew are provided with personal protective equipment
      such as masks, eye shields, gloves, and in some cases even hazmat suits.
      This is to protect the safety of the cabin crew who are frontline workers,
      and also to protect passengers and limit the spread of the virus.&nbsp; If
      you are travelling, ensure you check the airline guidelines as you could
      be denied boarding if you fail to wear a mask.&nbsp;</li><li>Reduced
      in-flight service:&nbsp; To limit interactions between passengers and
      crew, onboard service has been limited across many airlines. You will see
      pre-packaged kits that contain beverage and food combined, similar to a
      paper-bag lunch. Certain airlines have been placing water bottles on the
      seats prior to boarding in order to limit contact
      in-flight.</li><li>Reduced passenger loads: To promote physical distancing
      on flights, many airlines have reduced the maximum capacity of their
      flights, blocking out the middle seats to increase space around
      passengers. Other airlines have changed their booking policy, to allow
      increased flexibility - if a flight is full, you can rebook at no cost for
      a more empty flight.&nbsp;</li><li>Health screening before boarding: Many
      airlines have upped their screening procedures to ensure passengers that
      are exhibiting any symptoms, such as fever or cough, are not permitted to
      fly. You may have your temperature checked before
      boarding.</li><li>Contactless check-in: Many airlines have already adopted
      this process, but contactless check-in will become a normal procedure at
      airports around the world.&nbsp;</li><li>More connections: Route networks
      have been changed as a result of coronavirus. Many routes have been
      cancelled indefinitely which means more connections as direct flights may
      no longer be available.&nbsp;</li><li>More expensive: There is a chance
      that airline tickets will become more expensive. Because passenger loads
      will be significantly lower, airlines may raise ticket prices in order to
      ensure the route is profitable, when operating at a 50% passenger
      load.&nbsp; That being said, some experts disagree and suggest flying will
      actually be cheaper as airlines face unprecedented financial
      pressures.</li><li>Advanced onboard sanitizing: Airlines have been
      implementing increased measures to clean and sanitize the aircrafts. Some
      have even hired a new onboard position to have a crew member designated to
      monitor the use of lavatories and sanitize after every
      use.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><em>Hotels</em></p><ul><li>Reduced capacity: Some
      hotels have been implementing processes in which only certain floors and
      rooms are booked, to ensure more physical distancing and allowing more
      time for cleaning in between guests.</li><li>Increased technology: As a
      cost saving measure, you may see increased technology at hotels that are
      used to limit staffing needs. Similar to airlines, self-check in may be a
      new thing at more hotels.&nbsp;</li><li>No more mini-bars: Many hotels
      have removed mini-bars and complimentary coffee stations from rooms, and
      we probably won&rsquo;t see these return in the near
      future.&nbsp;</li><li>Temperature checks: Similar to airlines, many hotels
      are performing temperature checks upon entry.&nbsp;</li></ul>

      <h3><strong>Where will we travel?</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are
