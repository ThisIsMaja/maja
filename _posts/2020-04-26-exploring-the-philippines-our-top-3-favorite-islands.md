  <p>The Philippines is definitely one of our favourite places in the world! We
  visited the philippines 2 years ago together and fell in love with the
  beautiful islands. There are over 7000 islands that make up this incredible
  country and there&rsquo;s no shortage of amazing hotels, beaches, and things
  to do.</p><p>We were so excited to go back and see all that these islands have
  to offer. We spent 12 days in this paradise and it completely exceeded our
  expectations!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>WHEN TO VISIT</em></strong></p><p>High season in the
      Philippines is during the &lsquo;dry season&rsquo; between November and
      April. We went in February and the weather was perfect. Monsoon season
      starts in May and runs through to October with July and August being the
      wettest months of the year. &nbsp; The benefit of travelling during the
      rainy season is super affordable accommodations, and often you may only
      see a short downpour once or twice a day and sunshine
      throughout.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Cebu is one of the most popular destinations in the Philippines and the
      perfect place to start your journey. Getting here is simple thanks to the
      fact there is an international airport right on the island! We opted to
      stay in nearby town of Moalboal, which is southwest of Cebu. You can take
      the bus from Cebu South Terminal for around $4 and it will take
      approximately 3 hours.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>WHERE TO EAT IN
      CEBU:</strong></h4><ul><li><em>Shaka:</em> One of our favourite
      plant-based restaurants in Moalboal. Try one of their signature smoothie
      bowls or delicious fresh juices.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>&nbsp;<em>Venz
      Kitchen</em>: Small, locally owned restaurant specializing in Filipino
      food.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4><strong>THINGS TO DO IN
      CEBU:</strong></h4><ul><li><em>Kawasan Waterfall:&nbsp; </em>This was our
      first time visiting Kawasan Waterfall in Cebu and we were blown away. We
      arrived by 7AM and had the place to ourselves!&nbsp;</li><li><em>Swim with
      Turtles:&nbsp; </em>The snorkeling in Moalboal is amazing. Beautiful
      coral, lots of marine life and turtle spotting makes this a favourite
      dive-spot for travelers.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4><strong>WHERE TO STAY IN
      CEBU:</strong></h4><ul><li><a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-2421883&amp;aid=2017226&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2"><em>Ralph&rsquo;s
      Pension House</em></a>: Located centrally within Moalboal, right next to
      the ocean. The Kawasan Waterfalls are only 16kms out from this hotel,
      making it an easy ride over in the morning.&nbsp; Room rate will vary
      depending on the time of year but expect to pay around $50 for a double
      room per night.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-2421883&amp;aid=2017226&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2"><em>The
      Blue Orchid Resort</em></a>:&nbsp; Beautiful resort located at the quiet

      <h3>SIQUIJOR</h3><p>Chasing waterfalls is easy in the mystical, laid-back
      island of Siquijor. The island is a bit off the beaten path of the
      Philippines, located right under Cebu. It&rsquo;s known for having some of
      the most beautiful waterfalls around, white sandy beaches, and super
      friendly locals. You can get here via ferry from Dumaguete (40 mins), or
      from Bohol (90 mins). From Cebu, you can take a ferry to Tagbilaran, and
      from there transfer onto another ferry for
      Siquijor.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHERE TO EAT IN
      SIQUIJOR:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Monkey Business</em>: vegan-friendly
      restaurant with a cool island vibe: hanging swing seats and delicious
      Asian, European, and Filipino cuisines. Banana fries are a must-try menu
      item.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><em>Loka Loco</em>:&nbsp; Great spot for
      healthy, vegan food. Food presentation is impressive &ndash; try one of
      their buddha or smoothie bowls here for a filling healthy meal that looks
      as good as it tastes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>THINGS TO DO IN
      SIQUIJOR:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Cambugahay Falls:&nbsp; </em>This
      beautiful waterfall is a popular tourist spot, so go early in the morning
      to avoid the crowds. Take a swing on the Tarzan-style rope and jump right
      into the crisp water below &mdash;you will not regret
      it!&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><em>Cliff Jumping at Salagdoong Beach:
      </em>This is the most famous cliff jumping spot in Siquijor and for good
      reason. The water is the bluest of blues and you can get some really great
      photos here. If cliff jumping is not your thing, Salagdoong Beach is still
      a great place to relax on the beautiful white sand and enjoy the
      view.</li></ul><p><strong>WHERE TO STAY IN
      SIQUIJOR:</strong></p><ul><li><em><a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/ph/glamping-siquijor-by-the-beach-san-juan-siquijor.en.html?aid=2017226&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2">Glamping
      Siquijor</a>: </em>Basic accommodations (tents on the beach) but such a
      cool experience. Just a few steps away from the beautiful Solangon Beach.
      You will enjoy some amazing sunsets here.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><em><a

      <h3>CORON</h3><p>This was our first time visiting these incredible
      islands, and it was by far our favourite! We took a tour with <u>Big Dream
      Boatmen</u> for 3 days &ndash; and it was the best way to see Coron.&nbsp;
      This 3-day tour made the entire experience seamless. (We managed to get a
      10% off code &ldquo;MAJA10&rdquo; that you can use when booking this
      tour!)</p><p><strong>WHERE TO EAT IN CORON:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Full
      Lotus Restaurant:</em> Vegetarian and vegan-friendly restaurant with
      plenty of healthy and delicious options. Great ambiance, service and menu
      options.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><em>Brujita:</em> Small restaurant with
      limited seating but lots of vegan options on the menu here &ndash; ranging
      from curries, pasta, hearty salads and noodle
      bowls.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>THINGS TO DO IN
      CORON:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><em>Kayangan Lake: </em>20-minute boat
      ride from Coron and the scenery looks like it&rsquo;s straight out of a
      movie scene. We went paddle boarding here and it was definitely a
      highlight of our journey through Coron.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><em>Black
      island: </em>White sandy beaches and turquoise water&ndash; this spot
      reminded us of the movie The Beach and was a great spot to swim and relax
      in the sun.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><em>Twin Lagoon: </em>Likely the most
      famous spot in Coron and arguably one of the most beautiful.&nbsp; The
      crystal-clear water is surrounding by massive limestone cliffs.&nbsp; The
      views are incredible, and it&rsquo;s a great spot for
      snorkeling.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>WHERE TO STAY IN
      CORON:</strong></p><ul><li><em><a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/ph/treetop-suites.en.html?aid=2017226&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2">Treetop
      Suites</a>: </em>This boutique hotel is centrally located right on Calle
      Real street with great restaurants and shops nearby.&nbsp; Affordable room
      options with all proper amenities for around $50 a
      night.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-2422567&amp;aid=2017226&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2"><em>Dayson
      Hostel</em></a>: Super trendy (cute d&eacute;cor!) yet inexpensive and
      only 4kms from the Twin Lagoon</li></ul><p><strong>THE TRIP OF A
      LIFETIME</strong></p><p>This trip was definitely one of our favourites
      (ever!) and we can&rsquo;t wait to go back! Have questions or travel tips
