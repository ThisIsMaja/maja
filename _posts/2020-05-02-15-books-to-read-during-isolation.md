  They say reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body, let's get our
  minds in shape!!

  <p>We have always been big on personal growth, learning from anything we can
  like YouTube, podcasts, courses, books etc. It has been one of the biggest
  keys to our success, at one stage we had no idea how to take photos, we also
  had no idea how to build a business or how to create digital products, manage
  our money etc. We learnt because we have always had a growth mindset, no
  matter how much we learn we still focus on learning more.</p><p>With the
  current situation in the world, it is important to think about how we can
  continue to have that growth mindset while self-isolating. With more time than
  ever to focus on ourselves and focus on learning, what can we do? We can watch
  webinars, follow the online courses, do home workouts, network, read books
  etc.</p><p>In this post, we decided to focus solely on books. We have listed
  below the books that have touched us the most and given us the most value. All
  of these books in our opinion will leave you feeling inspired and motivated to
  become the best version of yourself. They say reading is to the mind what
  exercise is to the body, let's get our minds in shape!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><strong>15 MUST READ books</strong></h4><p><strong><a
      href="https://amzn.to/2yZXKUC"><u>The Alchemist</u></a> </strong>by Paulo
      Coelho&nbsp;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s get the obvious out of the way, as no
      self-development book list is complete without this one. This book is an
      epitome of inspiration. It shows the importance of following your journey,
      listening to your heart, and never giving up on your
      dreams.&nbsp;</p><p>If you ever feel like being stuck and have no
      motivation, we suggest you give this book a read.</p><p><strong><a
      href="https://amzn.to/2KSoid4"><u>The Mastery of Love</u></a></strong> by
      Don Miguel Ruiz</p><p>This is one of the best books about relationships.
      The author is talking not only about relationships with other people but
      most importantly with yourself. He raised topics about self-love and the
      importance of finding happiness within you, rather than searching for it
      in somebody else.&nbsp;</p><p>This book is quite short but yet very
      insightful. It makes you look at relationships from a totally different
      prospective and we highly recommend it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a
      href="https://amzn.to/3aR8H8d"><u>Linchpin: Are You
      Indispensable?</u></a></strong> by Seth Godin</p><p>This is a great
      personal development book that talks about how in this time and age you
      have to look at your career as an art. By doing that, you become
      indispensable in the workplace, you drive your career and you create a
      remarkable future for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      Sometimes the best way forward is to stop focusing on things that arenâ€™t
      essential in our lives.

      <p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2WdVLE8"><u>Seven Habits of Highly
      Effective People</u></a></strong> by Stephen R. Covey</p><p>If you have
      ever wondered why some people are more successful than others, and what
      they do differently, you should check this book out.&nbsp;</p><p>The book
      gives you simple but effective ways to improve yourself and your life. At
      the same time, it doesn&rsquo;t tell you to be perfect. It focuses more on
      progress and with it, you will also naturally improve.</p><p>This book is
      very easy to read but at the same time, it gives you a ton of valuable
      tips and tricks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a
      href="https://amzn.to/2KQD8Rn"><u>Man&rsquo;s Search For
      Meaning</u></a></strong> by Viktor E. Frankl: Conversation
      Starters</p><p>This book tells of the time the author spent in a
      concentration camp during the Holocaust. But this is not the main topic of
      it. Viktor Frankl writes about hope. That even in the hardest times life
      can be given a meaning.&nbsp;</p><p>The time of the Holocaust is
      incomparable to the current situtation, however, we think that we can all
      learn something from this book.</p><p><strong><a
      href="https://amzn.to/2WiA2ee"><u>Sapiens: A Brief History of Human
      Kind</u></a></strong> by Yuval Noah Harari</p><p>This is an absolute
      must-read for everyone. The author researched and combined science and
      spirituality while looking back at history to answer what it means to be
      human.&nbsp;</p><p>He looks into three main revolutions and how they have
      empowered humans to create and connect around ideas, such as religion,
      capitalism, politics, etc.</p><p>Even if you have no interest in history,
      we still highly recommend this book. This book will teach you a lot about
      the world and a lot about life.</p><p><strong><a
      href="https://amzn.to/2VWE0uh"><u>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a
      F*ck</u></a></strong> by Mark Manson</p><p>Some of you might have already
      heard about this book. In case you haven&rsquo;t, it has a different
      approach to other self-growth books. The author suggests to stop forcing
      ourselves to always be &ldquo;the most&rdquo; and &ldquo;the best&rdquo;.
      Sometimes the best way forward is to stop focusing on things that
      aren&rsquo;t essential in our lives. This book is about learning to let go
      in order to start enjoying life.</p>
