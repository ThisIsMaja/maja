  They say reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body, let's get our
  minds in shape!!
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>We have always been big on personal growth, learning from anything we can
  like YouTube, podcasts, courses, books etc. It has been one of the biggest
  keys to our success, at one stage we had no idea how to take photos, we also
  had no idea how to build a business or how to create digital products, manage
  our money etc. We learnt because we have always had a growth mindset, no
  matter how much we learn we still focus on learning more.</p><p>With the
  current situation in the world, it is important to think about how we can
  continue to have that growth mindset while self-isolating. With more time than
  ever to focus on ourselves and focus on learning, what can we do? We can watch
  webinars, follow the online courses, do home workouts, network, read books
  etc.</p><p>In this post, we decided to focus solely on books. We have listed
  below the books that have touched us the most and given us the most value. All
  of these books in our opinion will leave you feeling inspired and motivated to
  become the best version of yourself. They say reading is to the mind what
  exercise is to the body, let's get our minds in shape!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><strong>15 MUST READ books</strong></h4><p><a
      href="https://amzn.to/2yZXKUC"><u>The Alchemist</u></a> by Paulo
      Coelho&nbsp;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s get the obvious out of the way, as no
      self-development book list is complete without this one. This book is an
      epitome of inspiration. It shows the importance of following your journey,
      listening to your heart, and never giving up on your
      dreams.&nbsp;</p><p>If you ever feel like being stuck and have no
      motivation, we suggest you give this book a read.</p><p><a
      href="https://amzn.to/2KSoid4"><u>The Mastery of Love</u></a> by Don
      Miguel Ruiz</p><p>This is one of the best books about relationships. The
      author is talking not only about relationships with other people but most
      importantly with yourself. He raised topics about self-love and the
      importance of finding happiness within you, rather than searching for it
      in somebody else.&nbsp;</p><p>This book is quite short but yet very
      insightful. It makes you look at relationships from a totally different
      prospective and we highly recommend it.&nbsp;</p><p><a
      href="https://amzn.to/3aR8H8d"><u>Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?</u></a>
      by Seth Godin</p><p>This is a great personal development book that talks
      about how in this time and age you have to look at your career as an art.
      By doing that, you become indispensable in the workplace, you drive your
      career and you create a remarkable future for
      yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Although this is a great time to be productive and knuckle down on your
      goals. We also understand and have experienced ourselves how hard it can
      be at times with all the uncertainty.</p><p>Don't put pressure on yourself
      and be gentle to yourself. We are not 100% perfect everyday and neither
      are you or anyone else. Remember that!</p><p>Do you best and listen to
      your body and surround yourself with an uplifting environment. Thats what
      these resources are all about.</p><p><u>Let us know what you think about
      these resources if you know of them and add any others you know in the
      comments. As always sharing is caring and together we are better</u>
