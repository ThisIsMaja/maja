    body-content_html: >-
      <p>With over 100km of piste in Obertauern, there&rsquo;s so much to
      explore. The ski slopes are ideal for advanced skiers or snowboarders, yet
      they also vary in slope size and so it&rsquo;s also a great place for
      beginners to learn how to ski.</p><p>Obertauern is also located close to
      Salzburg and just 2 hours from Munich, Germany making it a fun weekend
      getaway if you&rsquo;re traveling from outside of
      Austria.</p><p>It&rsquo;s definitely a great place to spend some joyful
      and relaxing days. The 2 things we loved the most were that we could
      literally ski to within 50m of our hotel (a true ski-in ski-out mountain)
      and the fact that we were 100% guaranteed real snow regardless of which
      date we chose for our trip between the months of November and May!</p><p>I
      could go on and on - we love this place!</p>

      your time, the best snowfall will be in December, January and
      February.</p><p>The weather for our ski trip to Obertauern could not have
      been better! Every day was a fresh 0-3 degree celsius and we even had some
