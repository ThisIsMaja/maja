  <h2>why we loved obertauern, austria</h2><p>With over 100km of piste in
  Obertauern, there&rsquo;s so much to explore. The ski slopes are ideal for
  advanced skiers or snowboarders, yet also vary in slope size and so it&rsquo;s
  also a great place for beginners to learn how to ski.</p><p>Obertauern is also
  located close to Salzburg and just 2 hours from Munich, Germany making it a
  fun weekend getaway if you&rsquo;re traveling from outside of
  Austria.</p><p>It&rsquo;s definitely a great place to spend some joyful and
  relaxing days. The 2 things we loved the most were that we could literally ski
  to within 50m of our hotel (a true ski-in ski-out mountain) and the fact that
  we were 100% guaranteed real snow regardless of which date we chose for our
  trip between the months of November and May!</p><p>I could go on and on - we
  love this place!</p><h2>the best time to go on a winter holiday to
  obertauern</h2><p>The winter season in Obertauern, Austria, starts toward the
  end of November and lasts until the beginning of May. To make the most out of
  your time, the best snowfall will be in December, January and
  February.</p><p>The weather for our ski trip to Obertauern could not have been
  better! Everyday was a fresh 0-3 degree celsius and we even had some fresh
  snow on our first day. The conditions on the mountain were also perfect to ski
  or snowboard.</p><h2>things to do in obertauern</h2><ul><li>Skiing - 4 days,
