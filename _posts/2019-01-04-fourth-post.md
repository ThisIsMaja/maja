  <p>Austria is a magical place, and our winter ski trip to Obertauern has left
  us wanting more!</p><p>This was our first ever snow experience together and
  although I haven&rsquo;t been snowboarding in over 5 years, it was absolutely
  amazing.</p><p>We love to travel to summer destinations, but being in the snow
  together has been such a beautiful change of scenery! The towering mountains,
  the calming white landscapes, the peaceful atmosphere coupled with the crisp,
  fresh air all come together to give you this refreshing, peaceful
  feeling.</p><p>Once again we&rsquo;ve been blown away by the variety of
  wonderful offerings this incredible planet has.</p><p>If you haven&rsquo;t
  been on a ski holiday yet, it&rsquo;s time to plan one. We created this travel
  guide to fuel your wanderlust! If you&rsquo;re looking for the best winter ski
  destination in Austria, Obertauern is the place to go to.</p><p>Below we will
  link to everything we did, places you can eat (also vegan meals) and where to
  stay in Obertauern.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2>
