  <p>Austria is a magical place, and our winter ski trip to Obertauern has left
  us wanting more!</p><p>This was our first ever snow experience together and
  although I haven&rsquo;t been snowboarding in over 5 years, it was absolutely
  amazing.</p><p>We love to travel to summer destinations, but being in the snow
  together has been such a beautiful change of scenery! The towering mountains,
  the calming white landscapes, the peaceful atmosphere coupled with the crisp,
  fresh air all come together to give you this refreshing, peaceful
  feeling.</p><p>Once again we&rsquo;ve been blown away by the variety of
  wonderful offerings this incredible planet has.</p><p>If you haven&rsquo;t
  been on a ski holiday yet, it&rsquo;s time to plan one. We created this travel
  guide to fuel your wanderlust! If you&rsquo;re looking for the best winter ski
  destination in Austria, Obertauern is the place to go to.</p><p>Below we will
  link to everything we did, places you can eat (also vegan meals) and where to
  stay in Obertauern.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2>

      <h2>Why we loved Obertauern, Austria</h2><p>With over 100km of piste in
      Obertauern, there&rsquo;s so much to explore. The ski slopes are ideal for
      advanced skiers or snowboarders, yet they also vary in slope size and so
      it&rsquo;s also a great place for beginners to learn how to
      ski.</p><p>Obertauern is also located close to Salzburg and just 2 hours
      from Munich, Germany making it a fun weekend getaway if you&rsquo;re
      traveling from outside of Austria.</p><p>It&rsquo;s definitely a great
      place to spend some joyful and relaxing days. The 2 things we loved the
      most were that we could literally ski to within 50m of our hotel (a true
      ski-in ski-out mountain) and the fact that we were 100% guaranteed real
      snow regardless of which date we chose for our trip between the months of
      November and May!</p><p>I could go on and on - we love this place!</p>

      the best snowfall will be in December, January and February.</p><p>The
      weather for our ski trip to Obertauern could not have been better! Every

      snowboard.</p>
