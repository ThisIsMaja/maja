  They say reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body, let's get our
  minds in shape!!

  <p>We have always been big on personal growth, learning from anything we can
  like YouTube, podcasts, courses, books etc. It has been one of the biggest
  keys to our success, at one stage we had no idea how to take photos, we also
  had no idea how to build a business or how to create digital products, manage
  our money etc. We learnt because we have always had a growth mindset, no
  matter how much we learn we still focus on learning more.</p><p>With the
  current situation in the world, it is important to think about how we can
  continue to have that growth mindset while self-isolating. With more time than
  ever to focus on ourselves and focus on learning, what can we do? We can watch
  webinars, follow the online courses, do home workouts, network, read books
  etc.</p><p>In this post, we decided to focus solely on books. We have listed
  below the books that have touched us the most and given us the most value. All
  of these books in our opinion will leave you feeling inspired and motivated to
  become the best version of yourself. They say reading is to the mind what
  exercise is to the body, let's get our minds in shape!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>15 MUST READ books</h2><p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://amzn.to/2yZXKUC"><u>The Alchemist</u></a> </strong>by Paulo
      Coelho&nbsp;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s get the obvious out of the way, as no
      self-development book list is complete without this one. This book is an
      epitome of inspiration. It shows the importance of following your journey,
      listening to your heart, and never giving up on your
      dreams.&nbsp;</p><p>If you ever feel like being stuck and have no
      motivation, we suggest you give this book a read.</p><p><strong><a
      target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2KSoid4"><u>The
      Mastery of Love</u></a></strong> by Don Miguel Ruiz</p><p>This is one of
      the best books about relationships. The author is talking not only about
      relationships with other people but most importantly with yourself. He
      raised topics about self-love and the importance of finding happiness
      within you, rather than searching for it in somebody
      else.&nbsp;</p><p>This book is quite short but yet very insightful. It
      makes you look at relationships from a totally different prospective and
      we highly recommend it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a target="_blank"
      rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3aR8H8d"><u>Linchpin: Are You
      Indispensable?</u></a></strong> by Seth Godin</p><p>This is a great
      personal development book that talks about how in this time and age you
      have to look at your career as an art. By doing that, you become
      indispensable in the workplace, you drive your career and you create a
      remarkable future for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://amzn.to/2WdVLE8"><u>Seven Habits of Highly Effective
      People</u></a></strong> by Stephen R. Covey</p><p>If you have ever
      wondered why some people are more successful than others, and what they do
      differently, you should check this book out.&nbsp;</p><p>The book gives
      you simple but effective ways to improve yourself and your life. At the
      same time, it doesn&rsquo;t tell you to be perfect. It focuses more on
      progress and with it, you will also naturally improve.</p><p>This book is
      very easy to read but at the same time, it gives you a ton of valuable
      tips and tricks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://amzn.to/2KQD8Rn"><u>Man&rsquo;s Search For
      Meaning</u></a></strong> by Viktor E. Frankl: Conversation
      Starters</p><p>This book tells of the time the author spent in a
      concentration camp during the Holocaust. But this is not the main topic of
      it. Viktor Frankl writes about hope. That even in the hardest times life
      can be given a meaning.&nbsp;</p><p>The time of the Holocaust is
      incomparable to the current situtation, however, we think that we can all
      learn something from this book.</p><p><strong><a target="_blank"
      rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2WiA2ee"><u>Sapiens: A Brief History
      of Human Kind</u></a></strong> by Yuval Noah Harari</p><p>This is an
      absolute must-read for everyone. The author researched and combined
      science and spirituality while looking back at history to answer what it
      means to be human.&nbsp;</p><p>He looks into three main revolutions and
      how they have empowered humans to create and connect around ideas, such as
      religion, capitalism, politics, etc.</p><p>Even if you have no interest in
      history, we still highly recommend this book. This book will teach you a
      lot about the world and a lot about life.</p><p><strong><a target="_blank"
      rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2VWE0uh"><u>The Subtle Art of Not
      Giving a F*ck</u></a></strong> by Mark Manson</p><p>Some of you might have
      already heard about this book. In case you haven&rsquo;t, it has a
      different approach to other self-growth books. The author suggests to stop
      forcing ourselves to always be &ldquo;the most&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
      best&rdquo;. Sometimes the best way forward is to stop focusing on things
      that aren&rsquo;t essential in our lives. This book is about learning to
      let go in order to start enjoying life.</p>

      <p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://amzn.to/3bVkNyA"><u>Fear: Essential Wisdom of Getting
      Through The Storm</u></a></strong> by Thich Nhat Hanh</p><p>The author
      talks about the importance of acknowledging our fears. He starts by going
      all the way back to the origin of our fears. As the book continues, the
      author explains the importance of not letting fears take control over our
      lives while giving us examples of ways to transform our fears into our
      power.</p><p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://amzn.to/35jVjbI"><u>Do The Work</u></a> </strong>by Steven
      Pressfield</p><p>This book talks about resistance. That voice in your head
      that tells you that you can&rsquo;t do it, you are not good enough, and
      that you will never succeed. The author explains how to come to terms with
      this voice, how to overcome it and be able to create anything you
      want.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://amzn.to/3bVrZL8"><u>Medical Medium</u></a></strong> by
      Anthony William</p><p>We talk a lot about the importance of following a
      plant-based diet and how it has transformed our lives.&nbsp;</p><p>In this
      particular book, Anthony William gives so much insightful information on
      how you can heal yourself just by eating a wholesome diet. If you want to
      learn more about nutrition and what effect it has on our bodies than this
      book is for you.</p><p>In case you want to know more about our diet we
      have written a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://thisismaja.com/posts/why-choose-a-plantbased-diet"><u>blog
      post all about it</u></a>.</p><p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://amzn.to/35ltMqg"><u>Shoe Dog</u></a></strong> by Phil
      Knight</p><p>This book is a little different from the other books on this
      list. It is based on a true story of creating the Nike brand. It is super
      inspirational if you are planning to build your own brand and become an
      entrepreneur. The book talks about the reality of what it takes to create
      something so powerful and successful.</p><p><strong><a target="_blank"
      rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2YzYVVN"><u>Letting Go: The Path To
      Surrender</u></a></strong> by Dr. Hawkins</p><p>The book talks about the
      importance of letting go of old wounds and blockages, such as anger and
      guilt. All those things prevent us from being fully present. The author
      presents a simple technique that can be used anytime and anywhere to
      process our emotions, which will then lead to a happier
      life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://amzn.to/2WhVMag"><u>Becoming Supernatural</u></a></strong>
      by Joe Dispenza</p><p>The author explains how your mind and your body work
      together to create the reality you are living in. How to take control over
      your life. It also talks about meditation and how it can heal you. This
      book is great for somebody who is very logical and analytical, as it goes
      into the science of how meditation works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      own life

      <p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://amzn.to/2VSP0Zj"><u>Your Brain on Love</u></a></strong> by
      Stan Tatkin</p><p>One more great book about relationships. It explains
      attachment theory in a way that&rsquo;s easy to digest. It breaks it into
      three different attachment styles - the wave, the anchor and the island.
      The lessons we learnt from this book have been very helpful. It helps you
      understand other people on a whole different level. It helps to have
      compassion for people that you couldn&rsquo;t understand
      before.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are struggling to build a healthy relationship
      with somebody, this book might give you the answers as to
      why.</p><p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://amzn.to/3aNF7R6"><u>The Success Principles</u></a></strong>
      by Jack Canfield</p><p>This book connects and shares knowledge from
      several other popular self improvement books. The author did all the
      research for you. This book simplifies the tools and what you need to do
      to take your life to the next level. The first and most important
      principle is to take responsibility for your own life. It is so easy to
      blame your situation on the things that have happened to you in the past.
      However, taking responsibility gives you the power to do anything you want
      to. If you follow and apply all the principles from this book, your life
      will transform.&nbsp;</p>
