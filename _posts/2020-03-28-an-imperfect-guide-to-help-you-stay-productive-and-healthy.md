  how do we keep our healthy habits and our productivity when we wake up in a
  different country every other week?
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>Jake and I have been living on the road for the past 3 years. We are
  incredibly thankful for our apartment in Kuala Lumpur that is now our
  &ldquo;base&rdquo;, but still - we don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time
  there.</p><p>Having a consistent routine helps you stick to certain rituals
  that are good for you, like daily exercise or regularly writing into a
  journal.</p><p>So, how do we keep our healthy habits and our productivity when
  we wake up in a different country every other week?</p><p>This is a question
  we have been asking ourselves since we started travelling and working online
  fulltime. I believe that the most important thing is that you focus on
  a&nbsp;<em>few essential things</em>&nbsp;no matter what - things that can
  really improve your mood, mindset and daily productivity.</p><p>This post
  isn&rsquo;t to show that we&rsquo;ve perfected the art of routine (because we
  haven&rsquo;t - it&rsquo;s a process). Rather, this is to motivate you to kick
  off the new year with new positive energy and a great routine for you to make
  this year amazing!</p>
