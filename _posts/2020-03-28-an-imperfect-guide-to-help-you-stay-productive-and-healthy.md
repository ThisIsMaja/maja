  how do we keep our healthy habits and our productivity when we wake up in a
  different country every other week?
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>Jake and I have been living on the road for the past 3 years. We are
  incredibly thankful for our apartment in Kuala Lumpur that is now our
  &ldquo;base&rdquo;, but still - we don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time
  there.</p><p>Having a consistent routine helps you stick to certain rituals
  that are good for you, like daily exercise or regularly writing into a
  journal.</p><p>So, how do we keep our healthy habits and our productivity when
  we wake up in a different country every other week?</p><p>This is a question
  we have been asking ourselves since we started travelling and working online
  fulltime. I believe that the most important thing is that you focus on
  a&nbsp;<em>few essential things</em>&nbsp;no matter what - things that can
  really improve your mood, mindset and daily productivity.</p><p>This post
  isn&rsquo;t to show that we&rsquo;ve perfected the art of routine (because we
  haven&rsquo;t - it&rsquo;s a process). Rather, this is to motivate you to kick
  off the new year with new positive energy and a great routine for you to make
  this year amazing!</p>

      <p>We believe the key to our consistent high level productivity and our
      overall great health relies heavily on the fact that we are able to
      implement a morning routine no matter where we are in the world.</p><p>If
      you start your day right, everything during the days feels better and
      easier. This is why created our own Miracle Morning Routine that we try to
      stick to as much as possible.</p><p>The following 5 tips are easy to
      implement and have helped us to be productive despite having a busy life
      on the road. Here we go! ☺</p><p><strong>1. wake up
      early&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This year, we started getting up between 5.00
      am and 7.00 am. This shift is life changing when you can create a habit of
      waking up early.</p><p>Before most people are even awake, we have planned
      our day, exercised, tackled our most important tasks, showered and
      prepared ourselves for a happy, productive day. Waking up early makes you
      feel proud, like you can do anything because you left your comfort zone
      (the comfort of your own bed) early on in the day. ☺</p><p>It is great for
      multiple reasons besides being proud of yourself:</p><ul><li>No one else
      is awake, which means: no distractions&nbsp;</li><li>No phone calls to
      answer, which means laser sharp focus&nbsp;</li><li>Getting things done
      makes you feel good, you feel accomplished which leads to more good
      energy.</li><li>Once you have done most of your priorities, you can then
      take your time for yourself and check in with yourself</li></ul><p>To us,
      our mornings are the most crucial part of our days. They set the tone for
      a positive, successful and productive day ahead. We want to start our days
      feeling relaxed and calm, not rushing from A to B or jumping straight into
      our emails 5 minutes after our alarm goes off.</p><p>To avoid feeling
      stressed right after waking up, we make sure to get up early enough, we
      avoid looking at our phones within the first 30 mins and we do things that
      clear our minds and calm us like stretching, journaling and
      meditating.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. good quality sleep and water
      after waking up</strong></p><p>I also make sure that I sleep
      enough!</p><p>After I had my first and only cold sore on my lip (deutsch:
      Herpes) in January and when my skin was bad last year. I realised that I
      not only needed to eat clean but also get enough rest.</p><p>Personally,
      7-8 hours sleep is ideal in order to function well. I can recommend to you
      to find out how much time your body needs in order to feel
      well-rested.</p><p>Ideally, you wake up in the morning without an alarm
      clock. I am still in the process of getting into a rhythm where my body
      wakes up naturally. (This year I plan to use a sleep tracker to better map
      my sleep, I will keep you updated on the results).</p><p>So, after a
      successful evening routine and a good night sleep, this is how my morning
      routine start after waking up.</p>
