  how do we keep our healthy habits and our productivity when we wake up in a
  different country every other week?
intro-content_html: >-
  <p>Jake and I have been living on the road for the past 3 years. We are
  incredibly thankful for our apartment in Kuala Lumpur that is now our
  &ldquo;base&rdquo;, but still - we don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time
  there.</p><p>Having a consistent routine helps you stick to certain rituals
  that are good for you, like daily exercise or regularly writing into a
  journal.</p><p>So, how do we keep our healthy habits and our productivity when
  we wake up in a different country every other week?</p><p>This is a question
  we have been asking ourselves since we started travelling and working online
  fulltime. I believe that the most important thing is that you focus on
  a&nbsp;<em>few essential things</em>&nbsp;no matter what - things that can
  really improve your mood, mindset and daily productivity.</p><p>This post
  isn&rsquo;t to show that we&rsquo;ve perfected the art of routine (because we
  haven&rsquo;t - it&rsquo;s a process). Rather, this is to motivate you to kick
  off the new year with new positive energy and a great routine for you to make
  this year amazing!</p>
main-paragraph-emphasis: It all starts in the morning!
body-content_html: >-
  <p><strong>why we love a good morning routine</strong></p><p>It all starts in
  the morning! We believe the key to our consistent high level productivity and
  our overall great health relies heavily on the fact that we are able to
  implement a morning routine no matter where we are in the world.</p><p>If you
  start your day right, everything during the days feels better and easier. This
  is why created our own Miracle Morning Routine that we try to stick to as much
  as possible.</p><p>The following 5 tips are easy to implement and have helped
  us to be productive despite having a busy life on the road. Here we go!
  ☺</p><p>1. wake up early&nbsp;</p><p>This year, we started getting up between
  5.00 am and 7.00 am. This shift is life changing when you can create a habit
  of waking up early.</p><p>Before most people are even awake, we have planned
  our day, exercised, tackled our most important tasks, showered and prepared
  ourselves for a happy, productive day. Waking up early makes you feel proud,
  like you can do anything because you left your comfort zone (the comfort of
  your own bed) early on in the day. ☺</p><p>It is great for multiple reasons
  besides being proud of yourself:</p><ul><li>No one else is awake, which means:
  no distractions&nbsp;</li><li>No phone calls to answer, which means laser
  sharp focus&nbsp;</li><li>Getting things done makes you feel good, you feel
  accomplished which leads to more good energy.</li><li>Once you have done most
  of your priorities, you can then take your time for yourself and check in with
  yourself</li></ul><p>To us, our mornings are the most crucial part of our
  days. They set the tone for a positive, successful and productive day ahead.
  We want to start our days feeling relaxed and calm, not rushing from A to B or
  jumping straight into our emails 5 minutes after our alarm goes off.</p><p>To
  avoid feeling stressed right after waking up, we make sure to get up early
  enough, we avoid looking at our phones within the first 30 mins and we do
  things that clear our minds and calm us like stretching, journaling and
  meditating.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. good quality sleep and water after waking
  up</p><p>I also make sure that I sleep enough!</p><p>After I had my first and
  only cold sore on my lip (deutsch: Herpes) in January and when my skin was bad
  last year. I realised that I not only needed to eat clean but also get enough
  rest.</p><p>Personally, 7-8 hours sleep is ideal in order to function well. I
  can recommend to you to find out how much time your body needs in order to
  feel well-rested.</p><p>Ideally, you wake up in the morning without an alarm
  clock. I am still in the process of getting into a rhythm where my body wakes
  up naturally. (This year I plan to use a sleep tracker to better map my sleep,
  I will keep you updated on the results).</p><p>So, after a successful evening
  routine and a good night sleep, this is how my morning routine start after
  waking up.</p><p>3. morning journaling</p><p>I have never been a big journal
  person. I couldn&rsquo;t get myself to write down a lot of things or even
  describe my thoughts and feelings in a journal.</p><p>But last year, I started
  to understand how important it is to have control over your thoughts. After
  reading countless books and listening to several podcasts about how to be
  happy and successful, I found that the common denominator is to have a basic
  ritual. And one of those rituals to add to your routine is to
  journal.&nbsp;</p><p>Only a few weeks ago, I found a way to make the journal
  process easier for me.</p><p>I am using my&nbsp;<a
  href="https://www.intelligentchange.com/?rfsn=3332515.84c023"><strong>Five
  Minute Journal</strong></a>&nbsp;now that my life coach recommended to me, and
  it truly helps me to set my intentions for the day and raise my
  happiness-level by appreciating all that I have in my life.&nbsp;</p><p>I
  really like that its quick and easy to fill out and I am already starting to
  feel happier when I open it and start noting down a few things that
  immediately come to my mind.&nbsp;</p><p>The way it&rsquo;s designed is that
  you use it twice per day, early in the morning and before going to bed at
  night.</p><p>From the first page, there are inspirational &amp; motivational
  quotes that set the tone for you to start sharing your thoughts. It allows you
  to reflect on the previous day, and make goals for the next 24 hours.</p><p>I
  then journal down what I am looking forward to and affirm that I believe in
  myself. Affirmations are a tool that can help you shift your mindset from
  sadness to positivity and gratitude. When we believe in ourselves, anything is
  possible for us.</p><p>At night, I like writing down (in a few words) what was
  outstanding for me and what I could have done differently so I can make sure
  to improve the next day and try again.</p><p>Completing the days tasks leaves
  me feeling accomplished, empowered and motivated to keep following my dreams.
  You can even use the 5 minute journal on your phone, by downloading the app
  &ldquo;Five minute Journal&rdquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. get-to-dos and
  efficiency/ productivity&nbsp;</p><p>In our relationship, I am the one who
  needs structure when it comes to our work. It calms me down to know what my
  day will look like.</p><p>Jake never needed that, he has always been a free,
  creative spirit, but now that we are running our own company, having a to do
  list had to become part of our lives. I quickly realised that simply writing
  down all our to-do&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t really help us to be
  efficient.</p><p>I would always start with the things that I liked doing the
  most, and not the things that need to be done ASAP. Dividing our tasks into
  important vs. urgent tasks has helped a lot.</p><p>We have all been guilty of
  postponing the annoying tasks that are actually important, because we hate
  doing them, like booking an insurance or filling out a big form to apply for
  something? That&rsquo;s something we struggled with for a while.</p><p>We
  needed to start prioritising our tasks by level of importance. And I also
  wanted to approach them differently, so I started to look at them as
  &ldquo;Get-To-Do&rsquo;s&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Have-To-Do&rsquo;s&rdquo;.
  Instead of thinking about what I &ldquo;had&rdquo; to do I started being
  grateful for any and every task.</p><p>We love our job, so approaching them
  differently made a huge difference. I was so excited when I started working
  with my&nbsp;<a
  href="https://www.intelligentchange.com/?rfsn=3332515.84c023"><strong>Productivity
  Planner</strong></a>&nbsp;because this really helped me prioritise my tasks
  and allowed me to track how long it took me to complete a task.</p><p>Inside
  of the planner, you are working with a technique called
  &ldquo;Pomodoro&rdquo;. The Pomodoro Technique is designed to keep your focus
  stable and get you into your &ldquo;zone&ldquo;.</p><p>One circle on the
  journal is one Pomodoro and lasts 25 minutes. During this time, you work on
  one task without any distractions (no multi-tasking allowed!) and once the
  time is over, you can take a 5-minute break - and start all over
  again.</p><p>You start by listing out your main 5 priorities of the day and
  write out how many 25-minute-intervals you estimate it will take you to
  complete that task. You then fill out the circles as you go along, and finally
  note down how many Pomodoros it actually took you to finish it. This gives you
  an idea of how long certain tasks take for future
  reference.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. easy yoga flow &amp;
  exercise&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to being active, we don't follow a strict
  routine. Usually, we just do whatever feels right for us in the
  moment.</p><p>Both Jake and I usually practice a simple flow that varies every
  single time we get on our mats (or towels when we are traveling :D). We love
  getting inspiration for new yoga flows on YouTube or Instagram. They mostly
  consist of light stretches, lots of deep breaths and easy-to-remember
  sequences.</p><p>In 2020, we aim for at least 20 minutes of movement per day,
  no matter if that&rsquo;s a quick yoga sequence or a workout. When we work out
  while traveling we rarely have access to a gym. Therefore we have to get
  creative to exercise all the different muscle groups.</p><p>This year a major
  goal for us is to reach a new level of fitness and health which means we will
  be more consistent and work harder in our exercise routines. We will keep you
  updated with our progress on&nbsp;<a

  - the year for good health, happiness and productivity</p><p>We hope you
  enjoyed reading about what has helped us in 2019 to feel happier, healthier
  and more productive. We are still optimising and tweaking things as we go
  along, and we certainly want to set up a proper evening routine as
  well.</p><p>Reflecting and unwinding at night will be a bigger priority in
  2020, so that we feel our best and perform our best.</p><p>Let us know in the
  comments down below what your current morning routine looks like, and what you
  would like to read about next on our blog! ☺</p><p>If you found this post
