  <p>The coronavirus will have an effect on you one way or another.
  Unfortunately, the virus and its aftereffects have washed across the globe,
  affecting businesses, travel and leisure activities. There have been cases of
  infections in almost every country, resulting in lockdowns, restricted
  movement and widespread panic. Even if you are pretty sure you won&rsquo;t get
  the virus, just knowing about it and seeing updated statistics on almost all
  social channels can have you feeling exhausted, overwhelmed and
  unproductive.</p><p>Now, more than ever, we should take extra care not only
  with our physical health but also our mental health. Our moods and behaviours
  can indirectly affect those around us and when we decide to approach this
  coronavirus storm with calm, positivity and a clear mind, we can create a
  positive space filled with good vibrations for ourselves and others.</p>
