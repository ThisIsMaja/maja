  We traded in our bathing suits for safari gear and headed to South Africa for
  an amazing 2 weeks in the bush.

  <p>But, there was more to our South Africa safari holiday than just the
  beautiful African landscapes and incredible wildlife. We came to South Africa,
  along with EverSeenSA, to take a stand for something very close to our
  hearts.&nbsp;</p><p>It was our mission during this trip to raise money to
  protect the last just over 5000 remaining rhinos in South Africa. We are so
  proud to say it was a huge success with over $120,000 dollars raised for The
  Good Work Foundation and Care for Wild.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Where should you go for your South Africa safari holiday</h2><p>You
      are spoilt for choice when it comes to game parks in South Africa. All of
      them are rich in wildlife and are home to most of the big 5 which include
      the lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard, and rhino.</p><p>The northeast of
      the country is a popular destination for tourists as it&rsquo;s home to
      the Kruger National Park, the largest game park in South Africa.</p><p>If
      you are planning a South African adventure we can not recommend Charlie
      and Serena from <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.everseensa.com/en/home-page-en/">EverSeenSA
      </a>&nbsp;enough! Not only are these guys beautiful people inside and out,
      they are passionate about conservation, sustainability and protecting
      South Africa&rsquo;s wildlife. We are extremely confident these guys will
      design a trip for you that you will never forget. They will work with any
      budget. Just reach out to them and they will take care of the
      rest!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Why
      Kruger National Park</h2><p>The Kruger National Park has become a
      household name for animal enthusiasts and wildlife photographers. The park
      spans over an area of 19 400 km2 - which is pretty big!</p><p>Animals have
      free range to roam this area without being enclosed in cages. This also
      makes visiting Kruger National Park quite dangerous as you are in their
      territory and you need to respect the animals and their space. Throughout
      our time exploring the Kruger, we were constantly on edge, wondering when
      the next beautiful creature would appear and how they&rsquo;d react to us
      being there.</p><p>To date, this is one of the most incredible things
      we&rsquo;ve ever experienced and we&rsquo;re so excited to be able to
      share this opportunity with our followers.</p><p>For our safari we wanted
      to make sure everything was vegan so we decided to go with a small
      business run by a beautiful couple. It is called&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.selleysafaris.com/">Selley Safaris,</a>&nbsp;they
      provide the best vegan BBQ&rsquo;s and snacks and the guide is highly
      skilled and knowledgeable.</p><p>Where are other private game reserves
      outside the Kruger. Whilst these aren&rsquo;t as big, they do have most of
      the Big 5 and offer some great sightings. We visited both the Kruger and
      Welgevonden Game Reserve and spotted all the Big 5 in both
      parks!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Smaller game reserves near Kruger National Park</h3><p>There are other
      private game reserves outside the Kruger. Whilst these aren&rsquo;t as
      big, they do have most of the Big 5 and offer some great sightings. We
      visited both the Kruger and Welgevonden Game Reserve and spotted all the
      Big 5 in both parks!</p><h3>How much time do you need for your South
      Africa safari holiday</h3><p>You&rsquo;ll need at least 5 days to really
      enjoy your time on your safari holiday. We were lucky enough to have 2
      weeks and by the end of our trip, we had seen so many animals including
      lions, buffalo, leopards, giraffes, crocodiles, zebras, monkeys, hippos
      and hundreds of buck.</p><p>Also, try to include a trip to Cape Town if
      you have time. It&rsquo;s another one of our favorite places to visit in
      South Africa with great beaches.</p>

      <h3>Where To Stay On Your South Africa Safari
      Holiday</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><h4>Mhondoro Lodge</h4></li></ul><p><a
      target="_blank" href="https://www.mhondoro.com/"><u>Mhondoro Lodge</u></a>
      is a safari lover&rsquo;s dream. The lodge is situated in Welgevonden Game
      Reserve, which is actually closer to Johannesburg than it is to Kruger
      National Park.</p><p>The beautiful pool opens up to gorgeous views of the
      park where animals are free to roam. We had elephants right in front of us
      during our morning swim! It was quite intimidating having these majestic
      creatures peacefully go about their day, oblivious to us being
      there.</p><p>We went on several safaris from Mhondoro Lodge and saw all of
      the big 5 including rhino, giraffe, buffalo, zebras, wildebeest, leopards
      and elephants. Our highlight at Mhondoro was the amazing staff including
      the chefs who prepared delicious food for us and our guide, Dan, who was
      incredible.</p><p>After our visit to Mhondoro Lodge, we headed to the
      Kruger National Park where we went
      glamping!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><h4>Honeyguide Mantobeni luxury tented
      camp</h4></li></ul><p><a target="_blank"
      href="https://honeyguidecamp.com/mantobeni-camp/"><u>Mantobeni</u></a>&nbsp;is
      the ultimate glamping experience. It&rsquo;s inside the Kruger National
      Park with no fences and no barriers between us and the animals. You can
      hear them at night and it&rsquo;s an exhilarating feeling knowing that
      they could be meters away from you. On one occasion Jake was stuck in our
      tent unable to leave as it was surrounded by elephants!</p><p>We went on
      daily safaris from Mantobeni and saw the Big 5 and so many other
      animals.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Places to visit near the Kruger national
      park</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><h4>Blyde River Canyon</h4></li></ul><p>The
      Blyde River Canyon is the 3rd largest canyon in the world and it&rsquo;s
      absolutely gorgeous! Unfortunately, the weather wasn&rsquo;t playing its
      part on the morning of our visit, but it&rsquo;s still a great outing in
      include in your South Africa safari holiday.</p><p>There are a few
      different viewpoints and the lush greenery surrounding this canyon makes
      it truly unique.</p><h3>How To Get To Kruger National
      Park</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The closest international airport to Kruger
      National Park is OR Tambo International Airport in
      Johannesburg.</p><p>From here, you can either drive or fly to Kruger which
      is over 500km away.</p><ul><li>Drive: The drive from Johannesburg to
      Kruger is a long one, but the roads are in good condition and it's a
      beautiful, scenic 5-hour drive.</li><li>Fly: Kruger International Airport
      is located just outside Nelspruit in the province of Mpumalanga. The
      flight from Johannesburg is only 50 minutes but you&rsquo;ll need to drive
      another hour or so to reach your destination. This flight can be expensive
      so we recommend renting a car and driving instead.</li></ul>

      <h3>When Is The Best Time To Go On Your South Africa Safari
      Holiday</h3><p>The provinces of Mpumalanga and Limpopo in South Africa
      experience hot summers (December - March) and dry winters (June -
      August).</p><p>May to September is the best time to go on a safari as
      it&rsquo;s the dry season and there&rsquo;s little to no rain. June, July
      and August are the coldest months so pack
      warmly!</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Can
      You Do a South African Safari On a Budget</h3><p>As a tourist, your money
      goes a long way in South Africa. But unfortunately, a South African safari
      holiday is not cheap. Because this is a once in a lifetime experience, we
      strongly recommend that you do it properly and stay in a game lodge for a
      few nights, and go on guided game drives through the Kruger National
      Park.</p><p>To keep costs down, you can stay on the outskirts of Kruger
      National Park as there are more affordable accommodation options available
      here. You can also do self-drives within the Kruger.&nbsp;</p><p>All you
      need is a car to drive around and a map, which you can get from the Kruger
      gate. If you go this route, make sure you still do a proper jeep safari as
      the rangers know where the animals are and you&rsquo;ll see so much more
      wildlife this way.</p>

      <h3>Planning Your South African Safari Holiday: South Africa
      Visas</h3><p>Visa requirements for South Africa vary depending on where
      you&rsquo;re from. Check out&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/immigration-services/exempt-countries"><u>this
      site</u></a> for more info. Australian and German citizens don&rsquo;t
      need a visa so we were both lucky enough to enter South Africa with no
      hassles.</p><h3>Is South Africa Safe</h3><p>We get asked this all the time
      and with all the crime happening in the world, it&rsquo;s good to alert
      and ask questions about the countries you&rsquo;re
      visiting.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve traveled to South Africa twice and have never
      felt unsafe in the country. But there is crime, and you need to be
      streetwise. We wouldn&rsquo;t recommend hitchhiking or going anywhere with
      strangers. Research the areas you&rsquo;re staying in, and make sure you
      pre-book accommodation. Don&rsquo;t walk alone at night and keep your
      valuables safely in your bag.</p><p>Even the locals are wary of their
      surroundings, so make sure you are too.</p>

      <h2>Safari Travel Tips</h2><ul><li>The best time to do a safari is either
      early morning or before sunset as the animals take shelter when it heats
      up during the day.</li><li>Make sure you&rsquo;re properly covered when
      doing any outdoor activities and sleep under a mosquito net. Jake and
      Elliot got tick bite fever as a result of being bitten by a tick! These
      symptoms include headaches and high fever but are easily treated with
      antibiotics.</li><li>Pack a hat, sunglasses, and sunblock - even during
      winter.</li><li>Bring a camera with a good lens. The animal sightings are
      incredible!</li><li>Be safe whilst driving through the parks! Do not get
      out of the vehicle unless your guide says you can. And if you&rsquo;re
      doing a self-drive safari, make sure your windows are closed when the
      animals are near.</li></ul>

    main-paragraph-emphasis: Our South African Rhino Project
    columns: false
    body-content_html: >-
      <p>We spent months working on this project together with EverSeenSA and
      Omaze, who coordinated our travel and ensured that the projected was
      executed to its full potential.</p><p>Our aim for our trip to South Africa
      was to highlight and bring awareness to the rhino poaching crisis which
      has been on the rise for over a decade.</p><p>Yes, these beautiful animals
      are on the verge of extinction if we don&rsquo;t do something now! In 2018
      alone, over 750 rhinos were poached and killed for their horns, the
      majority of these killings taking place in the Kruger National Park.
      That's over 2 rhinos killed every single day.</p><p>These poor animals are
      killed for their horns which are sold on the black market. Some believe
      that owning a rhino horn is a symbol of wealth yet others think these
      horns have medicinal properties and can be an aphrodisiac. Just to make it
      clear - this is not true. Rhinos deserve to be left in the wild and not
      hunted for personal pleasure. We need you to help us in the fight against
      poaching.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Why We Need Your
      Help</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>International poaching gangs are equipped with
      expensive equipment and tracking devices to hunt these animals for their
      horns. There is a strong fight against rhino poaching, with people risking
      their lives every single day to protect them. We actually joined these
      heroes during our visit to Care For Wild, and it was terrifying!</p><p>All
      of this comes at a cost and not for profit organizations rely on funding
      and donations to continue their great work. This is where you come
      in!</p><p>We&rsquo;ve partnered with Care for Wild and Good Work
      Foundation in an effort to support and raise awareness against rhino
      poaching as well as to help empower and educate the children in the rural
      communities of South Africa. All you have to do is click on&nbsp;<a
