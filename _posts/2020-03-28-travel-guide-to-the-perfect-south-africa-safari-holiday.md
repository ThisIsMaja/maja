  We traded in our bathing suits for safari gear and headed to South Africa for
  an amazing 2 weeks in the bush.

  <p>But, there was more to our South Africa safari holiday than just the
  beautiful African landscapes and incredible wildlife. We came to South Africa,
  along with EverSeenSA, to take a stand for something very close to our
  hearts.&nbsp;</p><p>It was our mission during this trip to raise money to
  protect the last just over 5000 remaining rhinos in South Africa. We are so
  proud to say it was a huge success with over $120,000 dollars raised for The
  Good Work Foundation and Care for Wild.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Where should you go for your South Africa safari holiday</h2><p>You
      are spoilt for choice when it comes to game parks in South Africa. All of
      them are rich in wildlife and are home to most of the big 5 which include
      the lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard, and rhino.</p><p>The northeast of
      the country is a popular destination for tourists as it&rsquo;s home to
      the Kruger National Park, the largest game park in South Africa.</p><p>If
      you are planning a South African adventure we can not recommend Charlie
      and Serena from <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.everseensa.com/en/home-page-en/">EverSeenSA
      </a>&nbsp;enough! Not only are these guys beautiful people inside and out,
      they are passionate about conservation, sustainability and protecting
      South Africa&rsquo;s wildlife. We are extremely confident these guys will
      design a trip for you that you will never forget. They will work with any
      budget. Just reach out to them and they will take care of the
      rest!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Why
      Kruger National Park</h2><p>The Kruger National Park has become a
      household name for animal enthusiasts and wildlife photographers. The park
      spans over an area of 19 400 km2 - which is pretty big!</p><p>Animals have
      free range to roam this area without being enclosed in cages. This also
      makes visiting Kruger National Park quite dangerous as you are in their
      territory and you need to respect the animals and their space. Throughout
      our time exploring the Kruger, we were constantly on edge, wondering when
      the next beautiful creature would appear and how they&rsquo;d react to us
      being there.</p><p>To date, this is one of the most incredible things
      we&rsquo;ve ever experienced and we&rsquo;re so excited to be able to
      share this opportunity with our followers.</p><p>For our safari we wanted
      to make sure everything was vegan so we decided to go with a small
      business run by a beautiful couple. It is called&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.selleysafaris.com/">Selley Safaris,</a>&nbsp;they
      provide the best vegan BBQ&rsquo;s and snacks and the guide is highly
      skilled and knowledgeable.</p><p>Where are other private game reserves
      outside the Kruger. Whilst these aren&rsquo;t as big, they do have most of
      the Big 5 and offer some great sightings. We visited both the Kruger and
      Welgevonden Game Reserve and spotted all the Big 5 in both
      parks!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Smaller game reserves near Kruger National Park</h3><p>There are other
      private game reserves outside the Kruger. Whilst these aren&rsquo;t as
      big, they do have most of the Big 5 and offer some great sightings. We
      visited both the Kruger and Welgevonden Game Reserve and spotted all the
      Big 5 in both parks!</p><h3>How much time do you need for your South
      Africa safari holiday</h3><p>You&rsquo;ll need at least 5 days to really
      enjoy your time on your safari holiday. We were lucky enough to have 2
      weeks and by the end of our trip, we had seen so many animals including
      lions, buffalo, leopards, giraffes, crocodiles, zebras, monkeys, hippos
      and hundreds of buck.</p><p>Also, try to include a trip to Cape Town if
      you have time. It&rsquo;s another one of our favorite places to visit in
      South Africa with great beaches.</p>

      <h3>Where To Stay On Your South Africa Safari
      Holiday</h3><ul><li><h4>Mhondoro Lodge</h4></li></ul><p><a
      href="https://www.mhondoro.com/"><u>Mhondoro Lodge</u></a> is a safari
      lover&rsquo;s dream. The lodge is situated in Welgevonden Game Reserve,
      which is actually closer to Johannesburg than it is to Kruger National
      Park.</p><p>The beautiful pool opens up to gorgeous views of the park
      where animals are free to roam. We had elephants right in front of us
      during our morning swim! It was quite intimidating having these majestic
      creatures peacefully go about their day, oblivious to us being
      there.</p><p>We went on several safaris from Mhondoro Lodge and saw all of
      the big 5 including rhino, giraffe, buffalo, zebras, wildebeest, leopards
      and elephants. Our highlight at Mhondoro was the amazing staff including
      the chefs who prepared delicious food for us and our guide, Dan, who was
      incredible.</p><p>After our visit to Mhondoro Lodge, we headed to the
      Kruger National Park where we went glamping!</p><ul><li><h4>Honeyguide
      Mantobeni luxury tented camp</h4></li></ul><p><a
      href="https://honeyguidecamp.com/mantobeni-camp/"><u>Mantobeni</u></a><u>
      </u>is the ultimate glamping experience. It&rsquo;s inside the Kruger
      National Park with no fences and no barriers between us and the animals.
      You can hear them at night and it&rsquo;s an exhilarating feeling knowing
      that they could be meters away from you. On one occasion Jake was stuck in
      our tent unable to leave as it was surrounded by elephants!</p><p>We went
      on daily safaris from Mantobeni and saw the Big 5 and so many other
      animals.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Places to visit near the Kruger national park</h3><ul><li><h5>Blyde
      River Canyon</h5></li></ul><p>The Blyde River Canyon is the 3rd largest
      canyon in the world and it&rsquo;s absolutely gorgeous! Unfortunately, the
      weather wasn&rsquo;t playing its part on the morning of our visit, but
      it&rsquo;s still a great outing in include in your South Africa safari
      holiday.</p><p>There are a few different viewpoints and the lush greenery
      surrounding this canyon makes it truly unique.</p><h3>How To Get To Kruger
      National Park</h3><p>The closest international airport to Kruger National
      Park is OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg.</p><p>From here,
      you can either drive or fly to Kruger which is over 500km
      away.</p><ul><li>Drive: The drive from Johannesburg to Kruger is a long
      one, but the roads are in good condition and it's a beautiful, scenic
      5-hour drive.</li><li>Fly: Kruger International Airport is located just
      outside Nelspruit in the province of Mpumalanga. The flight from
      Johannesburg is only 50 minutes but you&rsquo;ll need to drive another
      hour or so to reach your destination. This flight can be expensive so we
      recommend renting a car and driving instead.</li></ul>
