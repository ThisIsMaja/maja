  We traded in our bathing suits for safari gear and headed to South Africa for
  an amazing 2 weeks in the bush.

  <p>But, there was more to our South Africa safari holiday than just the
  beautiful African landscapes and incredible wildlife. We came to South Africa,
  along with EverSeenSA, to take a stand for something very close to our
  hearts.&nbsp;</p><p>It was our mission during this trip to raise money to
  protect the last just over 5000 remaining rhinos in South Africa. We are so
  proud to say it was a huge success with over $120,000 dollars raised for The
  Good Work Foundation and Care for Wild.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Where should you go for your South Africa safari holiday</h2><p>You
      are spoilt for choice when it comes to game parks in South Africa. All of
      them are rich in wildlife and are home to most of the big 5 which include
      the lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard, and rhino.</p><p>The northeast of
      the country is a popular destination for tourists as it&rsquo;s home to
      the Kruger National Park, the largest game park in South Africa.</p><p>If
      you are planning a South African adventure we can not recommend Charlie
      and Serena from <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.everseensa.com/en/home-page-en/">EverSeenSA
      </a>&nbsp;enough! Not only are these guys beautiful people inside and out,
      they are passionate about conservation, sustainability and protecting
      South Africa&rsquo;s wildlife. We are extremely confident these guys will
      design a trip for you that you will never forget. They will work with any
      budget. Just reach out to them and they will take care of the
      rest!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Why
      Kruger National Park</h2><p>The Kruger National Park has become a
      household name for animal enthusiasts and wildlife photographers. The park
      spans over an area of 19 400 km2 - which is pretty
      big!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Animals have free range to roam this
      area without being enclosed in cages. This also makes visiting Kruger
      National Park quite dangerous as you are in their territory and you need
      to respect the animals and their space. Throughout our time exploring the
      Kruger, we were constantly on edge, wondering when the next beautiful
      creature would appear and how they&rsquo;d react to us being
      there.</p><p>To date, this is one of the most incredible things
      we&rsquo;ve ever experienced and we&rsquo;re so excited to be able to
      share this opportunity with our followers.</p><p>For our safari we wanted
      to make sure everything was vegan so we decided to go with a small
      business run by a beautiful couple. It is called&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.selleysafaris.com/">Selley Safaris,</a>&nbsp;they
      provide the best vegan BBQ&rsquo;s and snacks and the guide is highly
      skilled and knowledgeable.</p><p>There are other private game reserves
      outside the Kruger. Whilst these aren&rsquo;t as big, they do have most of
      the Big 5 and offer some great sightings. We visited both the Kruger and
      Welgevonden Game Reserve and spotted all the Big 5 in both parks!</p>

      <h3>Smaller game reserves near Kruger National Park</h3><p>There are other
      private game reserves outside the Kruger. Whilst these aren&rsquo;t as
      big, they do have most of the Big 5 and offer some great sightings. We
      visited both the Kruger and Welgevonden Game Reserve and spotted all the
      Big 5 in both parks!</p><h3>How much time do you need for your South
      Africa safari holiday?</h3><p>You&rsquo;ll need at least 5 days to really
      enjoy your time on your safari holiday. We were lucky enough to have 2
      weeks and by the end of our trip, we had seen so many animals including
      lions, buffalo, leopards, giraffes, crocodiles, zebras, monkeys, hippos
      and hundreds of buck.</p><p>Also, try to include a trip to Cape Town if
      you have time. It&rsquo;s another one of our favorite places to visit in
      South Africa with great beaches.</p>
