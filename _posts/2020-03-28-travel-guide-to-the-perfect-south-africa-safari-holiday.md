  Itâ€™s no secret that we love animals! So, we traded in our bathing suits for
  safari gear and headed to South Africa for an amazing 2 weeks in the bush.

  <p>But, there was more to our South Africa safari holiday than just the
  beautiful African landscapes and incredible wildlife. We came to South Africa,
  along with EverSeenSA, to take a stand for something very close to our
  hearts.&nbsp;</p><p>It was our mission during this trip to raise money to
  protect the last just over 5000 remaining rhinos in South Africa. We are so
  proud to say it was a huge success with over $120,000 dollars raised for The
  Good Work Foundation and Care for Wild.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>where should you go for your south africa safari holiday</h2><p>You
      are spoilt for choice when it comes to game parks in South Africa. All of
      them are rich in wildlife and are home to most of the big 5 which include
      the lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard, and rhino.</p><p>The northeast of
      the country is a popular destination for tourists as it&rsquo;s home to
      the Kruger National Park, the largest game park in South Africa.</p><p>If
      you are planning a South African adventure we can not recommend Charlie
      and Serena from <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.everseensa.com/en/home-page-en/">EverSeenSA </a>enough!
      Not only are these guys beautiful people inside and out, they are
      passionate about conservation, sustainability and protecting South
      Africa&rsquo;s wildlife. We are extremely confident these guys will design
      a trip for you that you will never forget. They will work with any budget.
      Just reach out to them and they will take care of the
      rest!</p><br><br><h2>why kruger national park?</h2><p>The Kruger National
      Park has become a household name for animal enthusiasts and wildlife
      photographers. The park spans over an area of 19 400 km2 - which is pretty
      big!</p><p>Animals have free range to roam this area without being
      enclosed in cages. This also makes visiting Kruger National Park quite
      dangerous as you are in their territory and you need to respect the
      animals and their space. Throughout our time exploring the Kruger, we were
      constantly on edge, wondering when the next beautiful creature would
      appear and how they&rsquo;d react to us being there.</p><p>To date, this
      is one of the most incredible things we&rsquo;ve ever experienced and
      we&rsquo;re so excited to be able to share this opportunity with our
      followers.</p><p>For our safari we wanted to make sure everything was
      vegan so we decided to go with a small business run by a beautiful couple.
      It is called&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.selleysafaris.com/">Selley Safaris,</a>&nbsp;they
      provide the best vegan BBQ&rsquo;s and snacks and the guide is highly
      skilled and knowledgeable.</p>

      <h2>smaller game reserves near kruger national park</h2><p>There are other
      private game reserves outside the Kruger. Whilst these aren&rsquo;t as
      big, they do have most of the Big 5 and offer some great sightings. We
      visited both the Kruger and Welgevonden Game Reserve and spotted all the
      Big 5 in both parks!</p><h3>how much time do you need for your south
      africa safari holiday?</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;ll need at least 5
      days to really enjoy your time on your safari holiday. We were lucky
      enough to have 2 weeks and by the end of our trip, we had seen so many
      animals including lions, buffalo, leopards, giraffes, crocodiles, zebras,
      monkeys, hippos and hundreds of buck.</p><p>Also, try to include a trip to
      Cape Town if you have time. It&rsquo;s another one of our favorite places
      to visit in South Africa with great beaches.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h3>where
      to stay on your south africa safari holiday?</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Mhondoro
      Lodge</h3><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mhondoro.com/">Mhondoro
      Lodge</a> is a safari lover&rsquo;s dream. The lodge is situated in
      Welgevonden Game Reserve, which is actually closer to Johannesburg than it
      is to Kruger National Park.</p><p>The beautiful pool opens up to gorgeous
      views of the park where animals are free to roam. We had elephants right
      in front of us during our morning swim! It was quite intimidating having
      these majestic creatures peacefully go about their day, oblivious to us
      being there.</p><p>We went on several safaris from Mhondoro Lodge and saw
      all of the big 5 including rhino, giraffe, buffalo, zebras, wildebeest,
      leopards and elephants. Our highlight at Mhondoro were the amazing staff
      including the chefs who prepared delicious food for us and our guide, Dan,
      who was incredible.</p><p>After our visit to Mhondoro Lodge, we headed to
      the Kruger National Park where we went glamping!</p><h3>Honeyguide
      Mantobeni luxury tented camp</h3><p><a target="_blank"
      href="https://honeyguidecamp.com/mantobeni-camp/">Mantobeni </a>is the
      ultimate glamping experience. It&rsquo;s inside the Kruger National Park
      with no fences and no barriers between us and the animals. You can hear
      them at night and it&rsquo;s an exhilarating feeling knowing that they
      could be meters away from you. On one occasion Jake was stuck in our tent
      unable to leave as it was surrounded by elephants!</p><p>We went on daily
      safaris from Mantobeni and saw the Big 5 and so many other
      animals.&nbsp;</p><h3>Places to visit near the kruger national
      park</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h4>Blyde River Canyon</h4><p>The Blyde River
      Canyon is the 3rd largest canyon in the world and it&rsquo;s absolutely
      gorgeous! Unfortunately, the weather wasn&rsquo;t playing its part on the
      morning of our visit, but it&rsquo;s still a great outing in include in
      your South Africa safari holiday.</p><p>There are a few different
      viewpoints and the lush greenery surrounding this canyon makes it truly
      unique.</p><h2>how to get to kruger national park?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The
      closest international airport to Kruger National Park is OR Tambo
      International Airport in Johannesburg.</p><p>From here, you can either
      drive or fly to Kruger which is over 500km away.</p><ul><li>Drive: The
      drive from Johannesburg to Kruger is a long one, but the roads are in good
      condition and it's a beautiful, scenic 5-hour drive.</li><li>Fly: Kruger
      International Airport is located just outside Nelspruit in the province of
      Mpumalanga. The flight from Johannesburg is only 50 minutes but
      you&rsquo;ll need to drive another hour or so to reach your destination.
      This flight can be expensive so we recommend renting a car and driving
      instead.</li></ul><h2>when is the best time to go on your south africa
      safari holiday?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The provinces of Mpumalanga and
      Limpopo in South Africa experience hot summers (December - March) and dry
      winters (June - August).</p><p>May to September is the best time to go on
      a safari as it&rsquo;s the dry season and there&rsquo;s little to no rain.
      June, July, and August are the coldest months so pack warmly!</p><h2>Can
      you do a south african safari on a budget?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a
      tourist, your money goes a long way in South Africa. But unfortunately, a
      South African safari holiday is not cheap. Because this is a once in a
      lifetime experience, we strongly recommend that you do it properly and
      stay in a game lodge for a few nights, and go on guided game drives
      through the Kruger National Park.</p><p>To keep costs down, you can stay
      on the outskirts of Kruger National Park as there are more affordable
      accommodation options available here. You can also do self-drives within
      the Kruger. All you need is a car to drive around and a map, which you can
      get from the Kruger gate. If you go this route, make sure you still do a
      proper jeep safari as the rangers know where the animals are and
      you&rsquo;ll see so much more wildlife this way.</p><h2>planning your
      south african safari holiday: south africa visas</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Visa
      requirements for South Africa vary depending on where you&rsquo;re from.
      Check out <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/immigration-services/exempt-countries">this
      site</a> for more info. Australian and German citizens don&rsquo;t need a
      visa so we were both lucky enough to enter South Africa with no
      hassles.</p><h2>Is south africa safe?</h2><p>We get asked this all the
      time and with all the crime happening in the world, it&rsquo;s good to
      alert and ask questions about the countries you&rsquo;re
      visiting.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve traveled to South Africa twice and have never
      felt unsafe in the country. But there is crime, and you need to be
      streetwise. We wouldn&rsquo;t recommend hitchhiking or going anywhere with
      strangers. Research the areas you&rsquo;re staying in, and make sure you
      pre-book accommodation. Don&rsquo;t walk alone at night and keep your
      valuables safely in your bag.</p><p>Even the locals are wary of their
      surroundings, so make sure you are too.</p><h2>safari travel
      tips</h2><ul><li>The best time to do a safari is either early morning or
      before sunset as the animals take shelter when it heats up during the
      day.</li><li>Make sure you&rsquo;re properly covered when doing any
      outdoor activities and sleep under a mosquito net. Jake and Elliot got
      tick bite fever as a result of being bitten by a tick! These symptoms
      include headaches and high fever but are easily treated with
      antibiotics.</li><li>Pack a hat, sunglasses, and sunblock - even during
      winter.</li><li>Bring a camera with a good lens. The animal sightings are
      incredible!</li><li>Be safe whilst driving through the parks! Do not get
      out of the vehicle unless your guide says you can. And if you&rsquo;re
      doing a self-drive safari, make sure your windows are closed when the
      animals are near.</li></ul><h2>our south african rhino project</h2><p>We
      spent months working on this project together with EverSeenSA and Omaze,
      who coordinated our travel and ensured that the projected was executed to
      its full potential.</p><p>Our aim for our trip to South Africa was to
      highlight and bring awareness to the rhino poaching crisis which has been
      on the rise for over a decade.</p><p>Yes, these beautiful animals are on
      the verge of extinction if we don&rsquo;t do something now! In 2018 alone,
      over 750 rhinos were poached and killed for their horns, the majority of
      these killings taking place in the Kruger National Park. That's over 2
      rhinos killed every single day.</p><p>These poor animals are killed for
      their horns which are sold on the black market. Some believe that owning a
      rhino horn is a symbol of wealth yet others think these horns have
      medicinal properties and can be an aphrodisiac. Just to make it clear -
      this is not true. Rhinos deserve to be left in the wild and not hunted for
      personal pleasure.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankyou to everybody who donated to our
      campaign and helped us raise so much for such an important cause. We hope
      you will all get to see what we've seen at some point in your life time.
      It is a life changing experience and something you'll never
      forget!&nbsp;</p>
