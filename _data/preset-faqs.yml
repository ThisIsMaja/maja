    <p>All photos and cameras are different, these presets will give you a great
    base to start from which you can make a few adjustments to really nail those
    pics down.&nbsp;</p><p>Not every preset will work for every photo, however
    we designed the pack so that at least 1 preset would work for almost any
    mobile photo.</p><p>Make sure you have updated Lightroom on your desktop to
    the most recent version, these preset files will only upload with the new
    2018 Lightroom Update.</p><p>AND</p><ul><li>Mobile Presets = .dng files //
    Desktop Presets = .xmp files,&nbsp;<strong>not .lrtemplate
    file&nbsp;</strong>(you need to update your subscription</li><li>Prices are
    in USD</li><li>Results will be great with any Iphone model 7 or higher,
