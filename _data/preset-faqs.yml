    <p>All photos and cameras are different, these presets will give you a great
    base to start from which you can make a few adjustments to really nail those
    pics down.&nbsp;</p><p>Not every preset will work for every photo, however
    we designed the pack so that at least 1 preset would work for almost any
    mobile photo.</p><p>Make sure you have updated Lightroom on your desktop to
    the most recent version, these preset files will only upload with the new
    2018 Lightroom Update.</p><p>AND</p><ul><li>Mobile Presets = .dng files //
    Desktop Presets = .xmp files,&nbsp;<strong>not .lrtemplate
    file&nbsp;</strong>(you need to update your subscription</li><li>Prices are
    in USD</li><li>Results will be great with any Iphone model 7 or higher,
    newer samsung/huawei models. Other mobile brands we have not

    below</strong>&nbsp;in the Q&amp;As, message us directly :)</p><h4>What app
    do I need to use Presets?</h4><p>The<strong>
    free&nbsp;</strong>Lightroom<strong>&nbsp;mobile app on your
    phone&nbsp;</strong>(I phone and Android).
    To&nbsp;<strong>install</strong>&nbsp;the presets on your
    phone&nbsp;<strong>you need a free unzip app for
    Iphones</strong></p><ol><li><a target="_blank"

    &nbsp;<strong>Lightroom
    Classic&nbsp;</strong><strong>Desktop&nbsp;</strong><strong>version&nbsp;</strong><strong>(OSX/Windows)&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;which
    you pay monthly (9$/month // one month free trial available). Our desktop
    presets are designed for the latest Adobe&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    href="https://goo.gl/6VnrfS">Lightroom</a>&nbsp;desktop version (OSX /
    Windows).</p><h4>I am a beginner, should I still buy your
    presets?</h4><p>&nbsp;YES! They are especially designed for people that like
    to edit efficiently or have never done editing to help you to achieve a fast
    and great result similar to our IG photos. Be patient with yourself,
    normally it takes years to learn editing, so if it takes you a few days or
    weeks to get the perfect results you are doing very well.&nbsp;</p><h4>Can I
    take photos with my phone?</h4><p>Our photos work for phone photos or any
    Cameras - JPEG and RAW settings as well as photos taken on a mobile phone,
    go pro or any other camera. Please remember that the quality of the camera
    and the light conditions does effect the outcome as well :).</p><h4>How will
    I receive the prestes?</h4><p>You will receive the presets via
    email<strong>&nbsp;right away</strong>. Make sure you use your current email
    address :)</p><h4><strong>Do they work on any of my
    photos?&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Yes! They work with all image types. Every
    image is different not every preset will work on every single photo, you may
    need to do some tweaking after applying the preset to achieve a particular
    look. This can all be done in the Lightroom mobile app and is very easy to
    do.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>what happens if I do not want to pay in
    Usd?</strong></h4><p>If you live in a country with a different currency,
    your bank will convert the USD into your currency. So you will be fine
    :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We hope this is helpful to you! Lots of
    love</p><p>Marie and Jake&nbsp;</p>
