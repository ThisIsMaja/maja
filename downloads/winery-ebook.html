  Everything you need to know about getting a job at a winery in Australia.


  - how to get a Visa


  - how, where, when to apply


  - how much you'll make 


  - job requirements etc

   

  There are two things that stop most people from living their dreams, it's a
  lack of these two things. 


  Time and money! 


  When Marie and I met we made a promise to ourselves that we would chase our
  dreams of freedom and travel. 


  But first we had to find a way to make enough money in a short amount of time
  to buy back our freedom. So we got seasonal jobs at a winery in Australia and
  everything worked out perfectly.
